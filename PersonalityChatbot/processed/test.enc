But
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
The "real you".
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hi, Joey.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Otherwise known as an orgy?
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Daddy, no!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Get out!
How many people go here?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
What about him?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Her favorite uncle
Assail your ears for one night.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Away.
Leave my sister alone.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
I just need to lie down for awhile
Kat! Wake up!
Were you in jail?
Start a band?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Oh, so now you think you know me?
So what did I have an effect on ?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Yes
State trooper?
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Hi.
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
You were right. She's still pissed.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Absolutely not.
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
You don't usually ask.
May I ask by whom?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
There'll be a time.
You seem to have a special talent for making friends.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
Chief knows.
Chief says -- he has a God.
How did you manage it?
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I suppose we're both old men now.
I knew you would.
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
What do you read?
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
... Into a monk...
I know, I should not tolerate his impertinence.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
But it's...
I will if they don't send me back.
Divorced.
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Are you hit?
He said he was her cousin.  I told him where she works.  They were just here.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
Yeah.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
What do you want?
I kill someone famous.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Tonight.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Any chance we can do that again?
And what do you do with the bones?
Are you married?
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Where's your partner?
Hi, I'm Honey.
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
Don't fool around.
How you erase this?
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
Yes, the money is good.
What are you doing here?
Viewer discretion advised!
I know.
Yes...he's my friend.
What are you coming here to do?
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
I'll take him.
Okay, you're under arrest!  Now you happy?
I'll send a cop back for you.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
He knew all along.
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Right. Just a sec.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I thought so.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
What is it, Hal?
I'm not questioning your word, Dave, but it's just not possible. I'm not capable of being wrong.
And don't you worry about it.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
CONTINUED
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Really?
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Yeah?
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Where's ganz?
You're done.  End of story.
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
Hey, this works pretty good.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
This place don't seem real popular with the brothers.
I been waiting a long time for some money.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.
Yeah, well the only woman of the Indian's we ran into was shacked up with her dyke girlfriend.  I guess she went with him before she came outta the Closet ... They both looked mad enough to kill him...
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Billy Bear...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
I got to wait for a call.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
I guess he got the message...
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
Yeah, one of my favorites.
Listen, Goddamn it if you think I'm happy about it, you're nuts. I just gotta take care of a few things, okay?
The number ... what's the Goddamn number?
Jack, wait...
Hello.
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
Who the hell are you?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
How ya doin'?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Let her go.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
Where's Leeloo?
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
Leeloo... is... she's...
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
Do you love her?
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You little sleaze bag!
6... 5...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Love...
Apipoussan!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You noticed..
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Exactly.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Been here long?
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Drink!
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
You think you'll have time for the water heater this weekend?
Why the gun?
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Is it?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
You brought the money?
What are these for?
Look, I don't know what this...
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
I know what you did.
What the fuck are you.. ?
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
You got absolute zero.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Yeah... guess so.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
Truman Capote.
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Specialty product.
Nothing illegal, it's always borderline.  Like if some freak wants to see a transvestite in a full rubber immersion suit getting an enema from a...
I told you, he's one of Dino Velvet's stock players...
What's this?
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
He succeeded.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
I'm not positive this means anything.
You told me to look, so I looked.
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
Neil... Neil Cole.
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
I don't know.
Why do you think he did it?
I didn't mean to...
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Will you let me look?
No... no... no...
Yes... I remember Mary
No, sir, he is not.
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Alice, you think you can leave?
It is...was. It's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
My mom taught me when I was little.  Did you ever hear of the dream master?
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
You don't really get it.  He's not a nightstalker.  It'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
What the hell was that?
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
What's wrong with me?
Feeling better now?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
But how...?
Yeah...I guess.
You disappointed in me?
Alice!
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
You do good work, Alice.
Where are you going?
They think I'm nuts.
They couldn't prove it.  No body!  Nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
Have another one, sounds like you need it.
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
How is he - ?
What is it?
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
I guess.
Hey - you know somethin'?  It's getting lighter in here!
Somewhere down there?
Dave - !
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Under <u>water</u>?
Huh?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
You don't believe me?
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --
I plan to. Soon.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
He's on to us!
Yep. Right about now the does are holing up in the brush piles. The bucks are right behind them and we're right behind the bucks.  This gun gets fired before ten o'clock. Whether it kills a deer or not is more less up to you. I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck the first four hours of the season. That's what you're paying me for, ain't it?
Double A. New Britain.
Safety on?
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Yeah.
Where'd you get the blood?
What?
Saw him do it?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
There's your old twenty-gauge, and that there's the new Browning you was showing me last night. This must be Twombley's gun. Brand new. Very fancy tooling. Probably fired one time. It's a beautiful piece of work.  But what the hell, Jack, I guess you deserve it. Right's right.
I'm sorry for the screw-up. But I couldn't help it it's too late to go trick-or-treating now. I couldn't help it I had to stop at Penny's for the costume. And you were hungry, remember.
Was it funny?
It's not that.
It's fun.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
It belongs to Pop.
What are you sorry for?
You don't want the extra police pay?
What's the hurry?
You mean Twombley?
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Yeah. A few things.
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
We should talk.
Good. Who?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
What way?
Then... I guess you have to.
Did you tell them?  That we were coming?
This is nuts.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
This town sucks.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
Jack?
The other guy.
Jillie, you want a cheese grilled sandwich?
You remember Margie Fogg?
Where's Ma?
Yeah.
Wade?
There was something. It happened up your way.
Twombley.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Yeah, I guess.
Find them everywhere. 
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
We'll talk at home.  You know, most girls aren't as lucky as you.  For most girls seeing the Bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
It was the experience of a lifetime.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
How we doing, Colonel?
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.
Apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders isn't as popular as we thought it'd be.  Representative Taylor is working on a compromise.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Because it is my duty.
Dead.
We're not going to make it.
Where are we now?
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
What do you want with us?
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
There goes your ride.
Madame Vice president. We have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off Lee, and reads it as she talks.
Finally, we can bargain.
Mr. Caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. How do you propose getting us from here to there?
I'll not going without my family.
The fax machines.
Please, Mr. President. You're going to get yourself killed. Is that your solution?
We're under attack.
Defense and State Department in the conference room in one hour.  I want to review the Iraq situation.
It's got to be stopped!
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
Elaine.
Are you afraid?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
I guess this is a first for you.
Can't we change course?
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
All right.  Here.
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
All right, it's a matter of death.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
George Zipp said that?
Well...not for another two hours.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I love you, Elaine.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Rain.
Rats! I've lost number three.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Yes, Captain?
Oh, I can't stand it.
How ya doing, honey?
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
Oh, I'd love to.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
Yes...
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
What is wrong?
Uh, Matthew...
To the... to the beach?
Stop the car.
... It's Harcourt.
Because... because of what will happen if humans see what we are capable of becoming.
What is it?
Yeah, the shells are too big for six in an cylinder.  Hell, Matt, you don't need but one.
That where Anderson worked?
Released December one.  He and his wife moved first to Modesto, then Coalinga, California -- wherever that is -- settled in L.A. in April.  Field of expertise: organic chemical engineering.  He and his wife have one child, a son.
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Yeah, I heard of it.
You took this gut out, too, didn't you?
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Hey, 'Top.'  What's the op?
Okay, let's do it.
Could it be intelligent?
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
That's right.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
What's he scanning for?
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
They cut the power.
Twelve meters.  Man, this is a big fucking signal.  Ten meters.
Nine meters.  Eight.
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
Why not?
They're dead.
Gone.
Wah...?  Where are...?
Is there a part for me?
How do you know?
You might be disappointed.
Why?
Don't bother.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
Why? People fart backwards.
No, I'm not playing this game.
Yes!
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Stanzi!
Why not?
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Come back tonight.
What?
What are you doing here?
Oh, yes.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Be careful!
Gertrude!
People who know say the girl's got talent. You must judge for yourself. If you think she stinks, say so.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
And here is our illustrious Court Composer, Herr Salieri.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
My dear, young man, don't take it too hard. Your work is ingenious. It's quality work. And there are simply too many notes, that's all. Cut a few and it will be perfect.
You are passionate, Mozart! But you do not persuade.
Am I not welcome?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Don't you have a maid?
Who? Who says that? Now that's a malicious lie!
What's that?
Why didn't you mention it in your letters?
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
No one calls you that.
Really? What is it he's writing?
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
I'd like to try them someday. I'm not sure I'd be much good at it.
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Down there, damn you.  Welcome to you. Pay no attention, they're impossible. Stop it, you willful things! Come this way. Just ignore them. They're perfectly harmless, just willful. I treat them just like my own children.
Never mind, Strudel. It's part of music, getting used to an audience. Aren't I right, Herr Mozart?
What is this, Mozart? What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry. No.
Love, Sire!
Did you like it, then?
How could I not?
How can anyone say that? We have no cook, no maid. We have no footman. Nothing at all!
They're stupendously successful. You can't get a seat. The only problem is none will hire me. They all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. As if I was some kind of fiend. I'm not a fiend!
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
You burned the score?
Mozart. It was good of you to come.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
Do you have it?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I'm not leaving you.
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
No, but I'm the best.
My dear fellow, the language is not finally the point. Do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theatre?
Mozart -
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
But not his body.
Oh my son, my poor son!
You mean that play?
Bravo, Your Majesty!
What do you mean - now?
Excuse me, sir, there is a lady who insists on talking to you.
He didn't say, sir. I told him I didn't know when you would be back, but he insisted on waiting.
Herr Salieri.
Bene.
How did he look?
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
What exactly did he call out?
Yes, sir.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Shall I send a car?
No, a cab will be faster.
David?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Call me Alex.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Do you like it?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Alex?
Do me an enormous favor?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
The zoo?
I should be committed.
What?
No.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Alex?
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
Are you cold?
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Right.
I have no idea.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
No, but he was on the moors.
It's in front of us.
Where are we going?
What?!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse!
Jack, are you really dead?
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
What can I say, Jack?
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
No.
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Yes - sure—
Matt?
About twenty-four thousand.
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?
Let me have ten bucks?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
And tell him not to delay.
What good will that do?
You know Dickson as well as we do. He'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
Character, hmmpf! That's your idea?
Most of the creditors I know personally. I've seen them grow up in the community. I knew their fathers and mothers before them.
What about?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
Where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh!
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Fifty thousand dollars!
Then what did you want to gamble for? If you'd have beat us out of fifty G's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? Well, we want our dough.
Be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. Understand?
Me?
Well—
What's this?
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
That will be just about enough! Now get out of here!
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
I don't know.
Helen, I'm going to Philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. Make all the arrangements, will you?
Mr. Sampson . . .
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
I haven't any.
Aw, I'm sorry, Mr. Dickson. It's just kind of sudden, that's all.  Sure, I'm excited. I think it's great. Only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . I'll never be able to thank you enough.
I already told him I was home.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
What'll we do?
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Oh, ten dollars—
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
Shh . . . !  I'll wait for you upstairs.
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
Never mind all that. What did you find out?
I don't care about the Dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
It couldn't have been earlier?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
We got a problem here, brother?
Corn gonna shoot at me?
Damn!
Hey!
You are a fine figure of a man.
What?
Thanks for the help.
The war? What, are you crazy?  There are things I miss about it.
Perfect, Cole.
I got seven thousand.
Jesse, we got to have a word.
What are you saying?
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
Beautiful.
Which one, right or left?
Jesse.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
What?
OPEN THE DAMN SAFE!
You 'um big lawman?
What is it?
Where the hell were you?
I had you covered.  From back there.
-- rode right into them, screaming like a banshee.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
That just might work.
You are a charmer.
How'd it go in there?
I don't think it's counterfeit. Do you mind if I take a look at all your real bills to compare?
And we're good at it.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
You're a piss-poor liar for the smartest man I know.
A war against the railroad. What the hell were we thinking?
How much of that story is true?
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Now let's have a drink.
I think so.
What about that Rock Island bastard?
... too young for whisky...
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Really?
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
That.
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Why?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
Yes, I am.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
I'm just leaving.
You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
Good coloring.
You saw the ad in the Times?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
Don't, I'll drink it.
Don't tell me...merchant banking?
Anywhere you want?
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
What...No! Put it in the carton.
I'm looking for...I guess you could say I just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
Patrick? I can't hear you.
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
Uh huh?
Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
Where did you go to school?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
Hang...out?
He had a yacht?
Well, maybe he did, huh?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" 
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
How's the Ransom account going, Marcus?
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's what they said it is. An unfinished broadcast studio. You were right... I just drove to Seattle and back.
Where were you?  You know you can't keep anything from me.
Here we go.
Right. Wait. A toast.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
He wasn't acting?
Milo?
My goodness.
If there's a Civil Rights violation. But generally we let the local police and DA do their work first.
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
We tried!
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
I'm okay. It's going well!
That's great! Thanks.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
I think you should go.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
What're we looking for?
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
You're compulsive.
I snuck into #21.
He's out of prison?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
What'd he say?
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Latitude 47 degrees.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
So how'd you like the house?
Every geek here's got a thing for Lisa. But that's about the biggest reaction she's had to anybody.
I could get it out of him.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills.
Or sometimes not at all.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
To my health.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?
I think it was Wordsworth who penned this little gem: 'Press the button, pull the chain, out comes a chocolate choo-choo train.'
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
Thank you.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Thank you, Exposition.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Be careful.
What's the other?
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
My meat and two veg.
What?
You've preserved my Jag! Smashing!
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Why?
We can't just sit here, Austin.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
I'm sorry.
Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
What do we do now?
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Danger's my middle name.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
Commander, I have to log it...
Ow! You shot me!
Austin Powers is getting too close. He must be neutralized. Any suggestions?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Thought I'd stay in. There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Blow me.
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... bottle ...
As you see.
People, too.
Hmmm ...
An unholy trinity ...
How Wagnerian ... Do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? That would have amused Peter.
Ah ... From Trubshaw's.  My shoemaker.
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Ah, Brenda ...  Mrs. Peel?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Either way ... may I ask: why you dress in that fashion?
But
That's what we were working on.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
This must be the last straw.
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
You lied.
I know all this.
Surveillance? By whom?
Who's now vanished.
The World Council of Ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
We want Mrs. Peel.
Anyone particular in mind?
Walk over to the window ...
Does Cole know about this?
Ooh, be still, my heart.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
That feels so great.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
You better not have too much joy.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
A strange wang right in my palm.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
I want women.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Now, don't get into any trouble.
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Goddamn it, Stephen, lay off!  You stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? You ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? Why you're gonna be stuck a Lt. for life?
Adcox, go with Pengelly and check the other side.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- Knock it off!
You stupid son of a bitch! What the fuck are you doing!
Well, look what we have here. Nice costume. Rent it?
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Why'd you come here, Brian?
So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Ready?
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Hey, what are you doing here?
Everybody did.
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You crazy son of a bitch, why couldn't you stay behind a desk where you belong?
Huh.
Carrying Swayzak's notebook?
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Hi.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
So you were happy here. Warm and cozy and in no hurry...  Soot high, clean unburned wall low, indicates slow burn in thermal balance.  Find me some glass.
What reason?
And Cosgrove. Coppers figured he laundered money for the mob before getting into real estate. They weren't very high on Seagrave, either.
I've got three different drafts of the same report -- with different numbers that're all over the place. Looks like they were just making it up as they went along.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Did you pull me out?
So what do you want me to do?
Four months.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
What?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Sorry I hit Jackson.
You want some coffee?
What's wrong?
Look, I'm sorry I --
Putty? On both doors?
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
Didn't think you'd make it.
Who's this?
And old ladies?
And the world -- the whole world.
You don't know... nobody knows...
Investigator Rimgale.
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
Yeah.
Nah...
Uh - right. Sure. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
Me?
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
What about the money you owe me on yesterday's game?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Keep trying.
Well you did.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
We're revolting against the powers that be, that been enslaving the minds and hearts of all people of color.  And we won't stop rapping till we bring about the overthrow of the government of the U.S. of A.
Yeah, him.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
We're ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
You can walk away.  We both can.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week.
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
How different?
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
You're now Mantan.
I want you to start using the name Mantan and not Manray if you don't mind.
Mantan?
How you sound?
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again.
It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
I want to speak with you.
That's the only reason, period. They only want one certain kind of black comic.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
You getting cold feet?
Your life will never be the same.
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
How's the food?
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
My visual style is very erotic, sexy, how do you say - hot?
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
To come back to our roots.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
...yes she did.
...then what about...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Don't try to change to the subject.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Certain?
Not even that.
Not one.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
By name only.
Then this must be done tomorrow.
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Yes?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
We got -- I don't know, we got separated
I don't know... I like the Army.
You smoke, Ray?
He's lying.
And he'd been shot.
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
He was sickly. Had that shaking thing, whatd'yacall it, epoxy?
Epilepsy.
Ohhhh, I don't think so...
Roberto, what the fuck?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
Ray, this is my life here. I ain't gonna pretend I'm not happy West is gone, but you know I couldn't have done this. It's not in me.
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
That's exactly what he says about you.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You... I've seen you around the Base. But you...  You're not Army, are you?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
I've done nothing wrong.  I'm the victim here.
You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar --
Well?
You lied to us, Levi, you're going to the gas chamber unless you tell us where to find them!
MAYBE WHAT --
Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you... I should have called --
The official term for it is "Clusterfuck". By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one -- a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...
And the problem is you only got three.
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
Home, I'm done.
What the hell are you talking about --
They're taking your command, aren't they?
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
You're crazy --
For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about --
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
He's in interrogation?
I don't think that has anything to do with --
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
Why do you care?
Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
That's a fantastic idea --
Yeah, I could've. Should've.
No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
We can tie you to the chair if it'll work better for you --
What?
I should probably write that down.
How?
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Pike never confessed.
Dunbar's telling the truth.
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
I used it to start the fire --
Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the murder of Sergeant Nathan West --
Tell him to shut up --
Yeah.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
What happens to Dunbar now?
Sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Yes.
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
That's terrible.
I never knew.
I like your stories.
Really?
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
You know anyone's who's taken it?
What, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
I saw my death in that eye. And this is not how it happens.
When did you ever work in an office?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
Do you know much about icebergs, Dad?
Dad!
I have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.
They're your favorite flower.
You don't even know me.
Are you Jenny Hill?
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I talked with your father last night.
Mmm, what?
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is he awake?
Yes.
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Yes. I know.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
No.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I...
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
How is bank?
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
What? No you're not..
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
What?
It's none of your business.
And who says what is wrong.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Get out
You don't have to say anything
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Are you scared?
What?
Goodbye.
It's not mine.
Is the flight full?
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Hey.
Sure.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU HAD A PLAN! YOU HAD A GODDAMN LIFE! AND SHE JUST FUCKED THE GUTS OUT OF YOU!
The fuck you laughin' at?
You wanna go home?
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I keep the heat on.
Let go...
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
Two days?
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
What do you want?
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
I don't fuckin' cook.
You take it straight?
My life is gone. Only life I was livin'. And I lost it.
I'm here with you.
By myself?
Are you drunk?  Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Huh?
She like it rough? You like beatin' on her?
First hooked up with that bitch when she was 16. Girl was fuckin' the principal and two of her teachers. You know coach Reynolds?
He tapped that.
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
I haven't laid a hand. On my life, R.L., my wick is dry on this.
You treat folks special when they company. It's just supper, R.L., shit.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Then what?
This ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
Back-up.
... I found the goombah... Cavello. He's --
This should be it...
This the right place?
Joyce can be nice.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
Why the hell not?
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
Chikuwa, Hampen, Kobu, Konnayaku, Ganmodoki --
No...
How many men?
Gaiijin?
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Why me?
He killed a police officer.
It is not allowed.
For God's sake, Ohashi, I need your help.  Let me out of here!
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
I like a man who stays put.  An admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. You live here all by yourself, do you?
Oh, no bother, I'd be glad to.
What, Sebastian?
He could?
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
No.
I want to do it.
She's not with you?
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
Not if it works.
You like to kiss her goodbye.
These aren't just...
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
What if you change your mind?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You see I lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... What am I supposed to be looking for?
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
What's suck night?
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
In your opinion.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I told you I'd come back.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to.  I guess I thought there was something more to it.
They could clean around the arrangement.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
What?
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Go ahead.
But in your profession that is a risk.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Discreetly.
But how come I'd be there?
What about friends?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Beautiful.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Your mom was a dancer?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Where are we going?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Perry?
Over this?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
See, ya.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Why not go to work for me?
What's the pay?
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Okay.
They're all divorced?
Two weeks.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
May I please be excused?
I certainly do!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!
It was at least as good as the sky.
A card?
Yes, sir.
I've got to go, now.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Gerade aus dann links!
Uh-huh.
That's what everybody believes?
I love Lucy!
Right on the button.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Not on him.
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
What?  What is it?!
The sky!!!
I don't see anything!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Sorry, Mom!
I'm afraid you've got to.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Thirty -five years!
Yes!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Let's eat our cake.
Mutants?!
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
What are you bitching about now?
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I see "elegant."
Well, what do you think?
Eve?!
Go to the bathroom.
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Fuckin' good, real fuckin' good. You know this little tid bit, Dorothy, and this thing, here,  is a neighbor. What the shit we're doin' with a neighbor, I don't know. Goddam!!!  This is the suavest guy I know. Look at you. You're one beautiful fucker, Ben. I love this jacket and that cigarette holder of yours. Shit, that is too fuckin' much. Where's those glasses. This beer's gonna get too warm. I can't stand fuckin' warm beer. It makes me puke.
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
Did I say that? I didn't mean it, or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Nice guy. Who's he?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
No. How could he? Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  Don't hate me.
I'm doing it.
Yes.
I love you Don with all my heart.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
I'll call you.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Mommy's here.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
What time are visiting hours?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
Oh yeah. What about those other people? Anything?
I've gotta go in.
I'm here, aren't I?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Alright.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Twice. Without her sensing anything?
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
You want to dance?
What are watchin' this junk for?
Come on out a minute, okay?
Shit. She's on every drug know to man. She'd have sold that thing for a dime bag. Screw her.  But I do kinda feel like an ass-hole.
I guess we really don't have a system of deciding who.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Charlie Bronson's always got rope.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
I don't know they just always need it.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
That was way easier than I thought.
Who did you kill?
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
So, what do we do now?
Can she I.D. them?
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
The Greeks. The Italians.
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?
That's one big fuckin' shoe!... and think about it. Of all the ways to kill a guy, crushin' him to death. That's very particular. You don't get many of those. I dunno. I feel something big here. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more of these turning up.
Who the...
How many bodies, Greenly?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
Witness?
This is some heavy shit. This is like Lone Ranger-heavy man. Fuck it! There's so much shit that pisses me off. You guys should recruit 'cause I am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?
Hey Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Liberating isn't it?
So?
Well, truth be known, those first ones just kinda fell into our laps.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Yes.
The laws of God are higher than the laws of man.
Don't do this my son.
Uh. Okay... um... you hear the one about the, no fuck that one... uh... oh! oh! Well... shit. Okay, there's a white guy. He's walkin' along the beach and he finds a, a pot, y'know and ah, he rubs it and this genie pops out. But this genie, he's a ni... he's a black guy.
Continue the joke.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
I don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
It had an alarm.
Loop around real fast.
Anthony, give me the fucking gun!
Where's the other stocker?
Why not?
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
Which one was that?
But if it wasn't for Dignan I probably would of died.
You were asleep.
Why don't you come with us.
I have an idea for that.
She doesn't need to know.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
How much?
She needed it.
When'd you get back?
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
Roger.
I'll see you there.
Does it float?
So how is it in there? 
What's he in for?
Nice to meet you.
Well, he agreed 100% that Bob should be dropped. And he also agreed you were a liability. But he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
Are you afraid?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
Can I ask you something, Mr. Henry?
Who?
I hope not.
I'm not playing any more golf.
You think I'm improving?
Sixty days?
I thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
Well, because you guys don't look alike.
Dies y nueve.
Does my skin feel soft, Anthony?
That's Anthony.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
What are you talking about, Bob?
Yes. I did.
Well. What do you want to do? You want to steal one or just drive your car?
The guy is fucking insane.
He electrocuted someone?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Is he chasing us?
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Not in that car you're not.
Yes, I do.
Just get in the car, Bob.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
Hey, Dignan. How's it going?
Bob, you're lying!
I'm sorry, Bob.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Yeah. We're in the elevator. How's it look back there?
Where's Applejack?
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
You keeping out of trouble?
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
What do you mean grammar?
Join the party, fellas.
Where is he? Where is Rob?
You a good pool player.
You Hoto?
Come on in!
Pleasure to meet you, John.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
It's hard to swallow.  The confusion -- the amnesia -- but he keeps on killing? It's more calculated than sick.  What about Nicky? She's the last one to see Bourne in Paris. She's the one he asks for. They disappear...
And pocketed a fair amount of change while doing it.
I did my box work, but I wanted to show you before I showed Landy. I came out here last night because none of this was making any sense. I mean, I'm with you on this, Conklin was a nut, but a traitor? I just can't get there.
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
Lots of people...
Is this really happening?
What do you want?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
I'm sorry.
-- car keys?
I worry when you get like this.
But we were so careful.
You drive.
Where are you going?
What if it's not who you think it is?
Jason, please don't do this...it won't ever be over like this.
I did.
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.
I want someone I know to take me in.
Where am I?
Here?
This is everything? Is there.
Mr. Nevins?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Am I a doctor, no, but...
Believed what?
Is it fresh?
Yup...  The main word there, the file heading, translates as: Treadstone.
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
It was in Latin, sir.
But... what will you do?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
If I pay homage to another's throne, then how am I a king?
But if we have not caught Wallace --
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm!
I wanna have supper waitin'.
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Against thy king, thou vile fool! Hast thou anything to say?
Did it work?
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country. And that royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Peace is made is such ways.
You have... you have a husband.
I cannot love you for the sake of revenge.
Wait! ...I respect what you said. But remember, these men have lands, castles. Much to risk.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
And you say he doesn't remember any of it?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Why? What for?
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
There must be a way to fix this.
What did you see? What did it look like?
Think Evan. You've invented a disease that doesn't exist. Alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
But I... I need those books.
I've stopped a hundred times.
Of course.
It was a long time ago.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
What do you mean?
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
Which is?
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Easy does it, Evan! Don't be a bad boy or I'll tell mommy you were naughty.
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Come on, go on...
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
What the hell are you doing?
I come from a big family.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
I thought I was the bad guy!
Lenny? Come on!
Here you go, buddy.
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Oh, yes, please.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Er, good luck, yes.
Hello, Rick.
It's not for sale at any price.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
And Mademoiselle?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
My German's a little rusty.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Yes, of course, we --
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
You can believe that if you want to.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
He came from Paris with Rick.
-- Is what?
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
No, Captain, please.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
And that is?
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
But I have no excuse to close it.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Hello, Louis.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
I was misinformed.
Oh, but I just told you. --
This is the end of the chase.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans?  Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
I would advise you not to interfere.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
For how long?
No. Not me, boss.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
Save some for tomorrow.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
Jesus.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Hmmm.  Feels like it might have gotten wet.
What brings you out to the sticks?
I had it on the island with me.
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
I can't even keep fish alive.
You know, for when you travel.
"We're" not over-reacting.
I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
Yeah?
So simple to say, so hard to do.
This is so unfair.
I love you, Chuck.
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Anything else?
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
Yes, yes he did.
Doc, I'm not on the island.  I'm not on the raft.  I'm alive.  I'm so glad to be back, I can't tell you.  I just want out of here.
Hey, once a driver, always a driver.  You want a lift?  I've just got one more pickup.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Don't you even think about it.
Kamal is not here.
I checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
You fucked us over.
This stinks really bad.
That's all there is.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
These *credentials* are against the law!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
*You're* a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
But you've studied with the old man for *years*!
Why not?
You cook very well!
What's she so emotional about?
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
I know.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Burma!
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
Uh... have you been *feeling* okay?
You don't miss it?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
You mean somebody asked?
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
Did you bite it?
A B-24 Liberator.
It's almost like flying.
What about the trees?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
Where's the name sheet?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
Uh... sure.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
When will he be home, Major?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
You're lucky he didn't cut your *nipples* off, man.
You ever see a palm tree, Homer?
Can --
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
A capacity for gross fund recovery. Yeah, we got that part.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Your life flashing before your eyes?
Alrlght, alrlght. What happened today?
I think so. The airport's going to be crawling with police. Traffic will be a nightmare. Go down to the bar. If they pull it off, great. Have someone deal with Ashby.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Jake...
I told you, use less powder.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Eight A.M. flight.
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
I' ll be honest with you, Kid. A grifter comes in here with a fifteen hundred dollar D-K-fucking-N-Y suit, cooler than an Eskimo in winter and tells me he wants to grift for me? First thing I have to ask myself is, is he playing for me or is he just plain playing me? You tried it once.
Come here. Feel this.
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
You're just going to have to trust me.
You told me to change my hair!
He was looking out for you.
Shit, what was that guy's name? I really liked him.
Stop waving that thing around.
It's bad luck.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
You better hurry. The police will be here any second.  I don't really understand my motivation with this. Why am I washing glasses?
What do we need another Shill for?
Why?
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
That's no problem. We have those in stock.
You going to have the time?
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
Aces, Suits.
The King? Jake, you play the heavy rackets like that... They put the lug on for nothing at all.
Just a tip.
What?
Preliminary forensics suggests he was sitting there, bloated and purple in his egg foo young for at least seventy two hours. Alfonse was not a small man and there was a lot of food ordered, so you can imagine the smell. Bad for the neighbors, good for me because in all the time I've been looking for Jake, this is only the second time I've even gotten a whiff of him.
Bullshit it's cosmetic! My fucking tooth was cracked in half. I made the son of a bitch write it in as a cavity. The department's dental is for shit.
Maybe another time.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
I'll try and make it.
I found her in bed with someone.
I don't gamble.
Good night?
Not entirely.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
I had training. In the Republic.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.
Why not?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Gambling's not about money.
Marion!  What did you tell the police?
So how are you doing, dad?
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
To coincidence.
So why did you come to my casino?
Near the casino.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
What happened?
It won't.
But if it does.
Would you like a drink?
Detective Inspector Ross.
I'm Lucy.
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
And the girls?
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
You use two alternating, don't you?
We do. 
It's a rule. Always stand by your first count. The odds are you're right.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
Yeah.
The key!
Key?
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Hey, Doolittle, here's one. An unstable planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Armed.
Huh?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Are you willing to entertain a few concepts?
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
Yes, well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
Any planets?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
-- Remark.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on this readout, but I can't seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.
Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
I'm glad you've come to talk with me, Doolittle. It's been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
We're running out of time, sir.
No wire.
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
That's not why we're here.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
That's a lotta crap.
Lemme put some clothes on.
No way.
I ain't mad at you...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!
If I give myself up in exchange for Sophy, would you make sure she's okay?
Hello...
But why can't we stay here?
First time I ever heard that.
Too early to tell.
So what are you gonna do about it?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
How'm I s'posed to ever sleep there again knowing some pervo's probably touched everything I own?
Whoa there, Tex!  We've been through all this.
Yes on all counts.
You'd think a guy who's taken on the job of saving the world would have a few more important things to do than traipse around after some girl.
L-Triptophane...a neurotransmitter sometimes used in homeopathy to control seizures.  Then the lightbulb went off.
I remember fine.  I just didn't understand what was going on.  They never told us anything except what to do.  It took me a long time afterwards to figure things out.
These girls, kidnapped during the last month and sold overseas to the highest bidder.  The oldest is twelve.  The youngest about the same age you were when you escaped.
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
What do you want?
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately?  That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back.  Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting.  He didn't either...at first.
You're also a fool.
My name's not kid.  It's client.  As in the person who pays for your opulent lifestyle.  Now, you got something for me or not?
Guy says he made the trade in Gillette, Wyoming sometime in the fall of oh-nine.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
They lifted my wallet to make it look like a robbery.  But there's a bug in my computer keyboard, a tap on the phone and a mike in the light fixture.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
No.
A fog bank.
They're prisoners to their genes.
And she bought that?
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Max--
She had me followed the other day and found out about Natalie.  Now, this person's demanding I blow her off or she'll do it for me by telling Nat about us.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
And why should she?
I just don't want Natalie to ever find out.  She deserves better.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
I was on call. 
He's sick.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Right, slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
Let's not think about the past. Let's just think about from today on. I'll never forget you, Jam.
What's it worth to you?
What are you, high?
Namely?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Very funny, Hawk. Okay, I'm in on this hare-brained scheme, but if anything happens to my mom's car, I'm blaming you. I'll say you drugged me or something.
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
Hawk?
It's my Bullworker.
What's gone?
They're what?
Oh, hi, mom.
They're not idiots.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Alright, Father, here it is. About two weeks ago I went to my cousin's wedding and one of the bridesmaids asked me if I wanted to take a bath.
I was insulted, so I asked her if I was wreaking some wicked b.o., right? Then she said no, she wanted to take a bath with me.
Well? Continue! Continue!
No. Much bet... I mean, much more sinful than that.
Jam has yet to do an overnight with us.
Well, here we are back at fucking school again.
Eyowch! This is one hot pizza!
Damn, she musta hot wired it. We picked up a professional car thief in the shape of Olivia Newton-John!
Is that your final answer?
Good MORNING!
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Each vessel travels along a vector path through space-time... along its centre of gravity.
Why did you make me flood the school?
You'll know soon enough.
Where did you come from?
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
That was a compliment.
Donnie?
What happened to your neck?
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
Where is she?
Did you call the cops?
The Lifeline is divided that way.
Fear and love are the deepest of human emotions.
People aren't that simple.
Grandma Death.
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
You're my only son...
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Because the rabbits are us, Donnie.
What's "Cellar Door"?
I think he saved my life.
Gretchen. We're going together now.
Do you think a lot about girls?
I asked you about school.
A sign from whom?
It was just like she described them in her book. Like they were alive. The way that they looked... moved... smelled. They were like workers... assigned to each one of us.  I followed my spear... and I found something...
Whoa.  That's OK, Dr. Thurman, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. I have sexual fantasies all the time too.
I know.
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
I have the power to build a time machine.
When will this happen?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
He was a year ahead of us?
It is a big deal.
I got twelve classrooms full of water. All coming from a busted water main.
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Yes. And believe me, of all the other mothers I would never dream of asking you, given the predicament with your son. But none of the other mothers are able to go.
All right! 7:55. Everybody goes home.
No more fuckin' for her.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
She's alive, sweetie.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
So, what do I say?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
"Once a carnie, always a carnie."
My mom wanted me to have this?
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
It's all the stuff I get to do. Oh my God, oh my God... Okay, okay... We get a "personal consultation" with a make-up artist -- Eeeh! Okay, um, there'll be a choreographer to the stars and, oh no -- No way. Oh... My... God!
All right, say "Airport Ho-Jo."
Airport Ho-Jo!
Loretta, don't do that.
I gotta work with these women.
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
I'm gonna need more caps.
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Here, I didn't get any.
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Well, excuse me, Annette, but I'm braggin' up your kid, here.  Amber's gonna be the next Diane Sawyer, y'know...
Annette, just use your hand.
What?
Tammy Curry?
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
It's always hard to see the young ones called home, especially on an exploding thresher. It's just so odd and gross.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Okay, I designed the float, you know. And, what's gonna happen here is that this is going to look like a glistening lake beneath the swan.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
Of course you're All aware a king must have an heir some one to pass the family name along will some one tell me where I'd ever get an heir if a king can do no wrong
"My dear"...
Here I am, Father...
Send for my car...
About - thirty-four seconds.
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
He's half poodle and half watch dog -
Half watch dog?
He only weighs ten ounces --
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's a-no good.  You gotta insult somebody from another country.  Look --  I come from one country.  You come from another country.  I say something you don't like.  You say something I don't like - and I'm insulted.
You've got a brain after all - and how you get along without it is amazing to me -- Now, who can I insult?...  Who do we owe money to?...  AMBASSADOR TRENTINO!  How about him?
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
Go ahead.
This has gone far enough!  This interruption is humiliating, to say the least...
Once more! 
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
You've made a wonderful impression. Your views are liberal... It is easy to see you have an open mind.
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Take a seat -- you're next. 
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Oh, would you...?
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
I thought everything was working out fine.
Did it go well, darling?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Well, these things take time.
What is it?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
What are you going to do?
What do you mean?
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
All you do is profit from another man's misery!
Yes sir.
I certainly sympathize with your problem, Treves... Why don't you try the British Home, or the Royal Hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.
It was a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Merrick.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
You never mentioned his mental state.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
It's all arranged. I'll send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany Mr. Merrick. You'll be using the Royal entrance and Princess Alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
Oh no, my friend...
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
My... name is...
How is your tea, John?
Mr. Treves, there is something I've been meaning to ask you for some time...
No, John, not one that I can see.
Ah, Mothershead. How are you feeling today?
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
Ah! So you admit there IS someone!
No. It's YOU who doesn't understand, Aud. Halfdan has come to kill and destroy. We brought him here. We must stop him.
How do we know this is the way?
Is it night or day, Erik?
What's the matter, don't you WANT to hear our singing?
Of course we're not; we'd genuinely like to hear you sing.
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Shut up.
What -- rape?
Oh, get it over with.
About raping me?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Why? Why have you got to go round killing and looting?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
I didn't mean to!
What's the point of being dead in the land of the living?
You must help us.
Now stop it!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Listen! Maybe we won't get to Hy- Brasil! Maybe we won't find the Horn Resounding... but at least we've tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
And you, Keitel Blacksmith.
Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
Only the dead reach Asgaard, Erik.
Look, I bagged it last week.
I AM one, Dad!
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Let me go, Sven.
I'm not worth risking your life for.
My brother blacksmiths!
Together we stand!
Made by YOU, Loki!
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. Just make a clean break.
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
How are you today?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Rockville Center.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
I'm Joel.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
I'm not a stalker.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Yeah?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
You should stay.
How can you watch this crap?
I scoured the city for it.
Right. Something black though.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Okay.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
You said...
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
I do sort of live with somebody though.
What are you doing?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Yeah.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
Doesn't sound like me.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Hmmm. Do you miss me?
I don't know. Panties and --
Hi.
Clementine.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
Clementine.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
I'm sorry.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Yeah. Cool.
Very cool. Trippy.
Stan... c'mon...
We haven't checked.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Where?
I don't know! I just said that!
What do you want, Stan?
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Did you try going through C-Gate?
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Just wanted to let you know.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
I know who you are.
Clockworks.
Siwash, huh?
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where are the others?
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
I was a successful model once.
So now you're bummin' around?
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
Tired...
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
We have a man down...
You weren't there. I saw it.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
I'm gonna activate the emergency beacon.
Please... kill...
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Jesus its huge.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Alive?
Skipper...
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
No one?
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
It's 2041...
I want to know what caused that noise. I want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
It is now.  We're locked in.
Do we have enough time for a weld?
Captain, we got a problem.
What is it, Smith?
Something's wrong with the bio-scan.
Who?
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
It's cold.
I didn't see anything and I don't have to see anything. This ship is fucked.
I don't think She's real big on hate.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I can handle the ship. I can even handle Mr. Blonde Ambition. But I don't know if I should be flying or playing Vegas in these suits. Who the hell came up with them?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Where is Reed?
I can't take this.
Maybe you should think about yourself for once. You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Isn't that your speech?
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
It's about to be a broken face.
We're working as hard as we can --
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Hey! That's a prototype!
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Sweet.
Front page?
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
That's good. That's uh... good.
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger. Can you remember the exact emotions when --
There were a lot of variables to consider --
What are you doing?
Remember our first date here...? God, I was so nervous.
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Got it. So take a walk, Ben... I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Just a little banged up. A couple scrapes. Why?
It's just business.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Where did you hear that?
No.
Any problems?
Come on. Clean that counter off Brad. Let's go. Play ball.
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Leave me alone.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
Hey, Mike?
What's wrong?
I didn't see you this morning.
Well, what do you want me to do? Go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'Hello! I'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Damone. It's Mark.
You're losing it, Damone.
Not if you're over sixteen.
Should we buy a frame for that?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What do you think?
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Dartmouth?!
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Can I come in?
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
How about the point?
I think I better take you home.
Thanks for coming to get me.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
I made a fool of myself.
Well, I don't know, I may be doing some traveling this summer. I don't know how much I'll be around...  But I'll give you a call sometime.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Crying? Why was she crying?
Hell, no. We'd never hear the goddamn end of it.
Dobermans don't talk.
What happened? What did they do to her?
Really?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
That's the press table. Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with. You handle that, and I'll check on the room.
Total control now. Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people!
Can we make it?
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
You bastard! I need a lawyer immediately!
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
NO! Stop talking like that.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Never mind, it's absolutely pure.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
So do we, lady.
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?
Spare me.
Stop!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
We can't risk letting them in.
I will not die because of him!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
So, your husband ditched you?
You're trusting that guy? He'll ditch us and never look back.
Scared?
Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
Your parents of relation?
We gotta be close.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
Push and twist, it's child proof.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Will I go crazy or something?
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
He only shot you once.
What do you mean what?
Fully.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
They were all over the place.
Got 'cha!
Move slow and move quiet.
You don't want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
We all have to be strong, right?
What have you done now, broke the darn thing?
Hi Frances, got a minute?
I'm not!
You're afraid!
I'm not!
Huh.
Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is, Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast, but we haven't found our female lead...
Hello, Harold.
What?! Good Lord no, it's just... It's money. We needed backing and... well, we found it.
What does Clifford say?
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
I know you believe that.
...Don't you?
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
But I'll never win that.
Thanks, Dad.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and... 
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Please, Francie...
Thank you.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
...Not if I can help it.
Just one minute...
Yeah, well --
I just wanted to see how you looked.
Frances...
I know what ability you're interested in.
Don't start, Farmer.
Frances...
I'll bet.
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
Anyway... if you need me...
Been a lot of years, you know. A long time waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.
How... how ya doin', Farmer?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Who're you?
Your big speech?
The speech? Real good.
I don't care.
It's okay.
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
What?
I think I need a little air.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I'm back, Mama.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
But what -- 
Oh! Are you really?
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
Please sit down...
Stay calm, please.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
Yes. It was very good to see her.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
And he drove me to mine.
What kindness?
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Friend?
He always was opinionated.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
I wish to be your wife.
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I give you my soul...
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Professor?
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
Now you've got him started.
He was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
Keep your voice down. You don't know what you're saying.
I resent God's monopoly.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
How much longer?
Thank God your fever broke.  Slowly, now. Just a sip.  I've been worried we might lose you. It's been touch-and-go for a week.
We feared cholera. Turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
What happened up there?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
So you have claimed. Yet you have no explanation for this.  The locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. The locket you so coveted.  How did it come to be in your possession?
Philosophical?
Paracelsus?
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Electricity.
How is it you come to be here?
You know of it?
Melvin Belli.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I don't hear it anymore.
I'm sorry.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
Holy shit...
I love you.
What about Neddy?
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
Looks like a storm.
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Mmmmmmmph?
Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy.
Girls can't be cowboys.
You okay?
Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens...
They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
How much do I owe you?
You like the car?
Now, you listen to me. You ain't gonna do a goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I'm running this show, I make the decisions.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Auto wreck.
Yes.
You're a preacher?
Why'd ya quit?
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
If he touches her, I'll kill him. I don't give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing him.
Pass.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
You too, preacher?
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
No!
How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round two?
How many bullets left, kid?
-- you got your microwave --
-- you got your shower --
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
Are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Gotcha!
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
All I'm saying --
How do you know?
Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation. What's the matter with you?
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
We are...  "South of the border down Mexico way."
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
Where are you right now?
I'm here with you.
My shit is together.
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
You could take their head off.
Who's "we"?
I've been accused of that wish.
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Of course, but there's more --
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
No, sir, WHAT?
Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language.  So one standard.  Is that what you're after?
I'm not sure what --
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Yes?
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Can't complain, ma'am.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
You were never going to let women serve in combat.  You always had a safety net.  Or thought you did.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
Hey.  You okay, Flea?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
Probably hear back from CNN first.
This has nothing to do with you.
Get your dick back here.  It has everything to do with you.
Jordan...
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce.  Much less keep up with my phone life.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
'Cool?
Maybe half.  Not even.
I think you're the liar.
Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that?
Sure.  Just like your men do.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Congress cuts, military bleeds.  But Pentagon's a big place.  Let's narrow the sights.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The White House.  If Jordan wins, DeHaven wins in spades.  Why?  Well, it's been said that the only man the President fears -- ain't no man.
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I take it this file is still open.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
What are you doing?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
When you and I use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. But from the inside now I can actually effect change.  I never lost my idealism.
I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
Are you okay?
Wish me luck!
What do I get?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Mr. Caiman...
What?
We? I don't think so.
Excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell I'm doing here?
Look, I may work for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
No, it reproduces asexually. That's why we must find the nest. If we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
Organize a search party. I want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
Are you looking for this?
SDECE, Service de Documentation Exterieure et de Contre-Espionnage. Agent Phillip Raymond.
Sounds like a big company.
We have learned that your American friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
How do I do that?
Who the hell are you?
It's Raymond.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Sir! The pressure.  It's normalizing.
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
God, what an ass.
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
He wants to THINK!?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You could order something in.
May I get the check?
"Go into the cloud! ...
Look at that... Will you LOOK at that... They look like little children...
No I didn't.
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
It's okay. Listen-
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
Well, that's the big question, isn't it?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
There is no weather in space.
What does that mean?!!!  Yes, I see! Yes... It means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
You Okay, Alex?
...Okay
We're screwed... We're so screwed...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
Hey... Hey where are you going?
Are they behind us?
Jason.. Can you hear me?
He's accelerating to Mark 6.
never doubted you for a second.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Mind If we skip that?  I have to get back pretty quick for this thing in Van Nuys.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
You what?.. What are you talking about?
A model, only as big as this.
But...Why?
Anything.
Okay... On what?
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Hold course, Laredo!
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
What do you think, George, shall I resign?  It's what they want.
Someday, George, you may need to act for the good of the people no matter what Congress thinks that is.  It may come down to us, or them someday.  You or them.  Cicero was right:  was is 'a time when the laws are silent'.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Our plan is to hit them as they leave.
Misunderstood what!?
What?  What are you talking about?
Wil, I want to remind you of a conversation we started just before Monmouth...
And, is that a pitchfork beside him?
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Sir, Arnold is a traitor.
What is this?
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
Makes you gag.
No one wants another failure right now, God knows.  But people like Arnold and, God knows, I'm having my fears about General Washington.
Did God ever make such a pitiful army?
We already have black soldiers in our army...
That damned Arnold is here, isn't he?  Did you know he lost all his ships?  Outrageous and completely unacceptable.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
And, Hamilton?  Greene?
Gentlemen, let me get to the point, I can't see the wisdom of pursuing this old court-martial against General Arnold.
The man is a traitor!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
I only meant...
And how rusty are these muskets?
Our beloved father, the King, also refuses to bend.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
What else?  From Virginia?
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws.  One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
So, you are William's wild young neighbor?  Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family.  I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Then why are you teaching me...?
I always though London was the place to be:  capital of the world, the most spectacular city on earth.
What are you doing?
I'm lost in ecstasy!  And dost thou love, Thou charming maid?
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
I guess still in the locker.
He's gonna plea-deal his way out. Give up this ace stunt man now one of the West Coast dope kings, if they go easy on the Cat.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Well, I don't know. I gave the man his money, sent him on his way.
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Listen, Harry, how would you like to get your hands on five hundred grand? You pay me back at your convenience, no interest.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
I don't know.
Who?
You say look at you?
You a quick draw... 'bro?' You better be, your piece stuck way down in your belt like that.
You have a card in here?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
What've you got?
But you work for the casino?
You're trying to tell me how you fucked up without sounding stupid, and that's hard to do. Let's just get to where you're at, okay? You blew the two hundred grand the limo guys gave you in Vegas on a basketball game and you haven't told 'em about it. Why not?
"Mr. Lovejoy"? That's the title?
Doris, Murray's widow, finds out about this Martin Weir thing and says since Murray and I never had any written contract, she wants five hundred grand for the script.
Just a thought.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Maybe I oughta talk to this Ray Bones character myself. See if he wants to invest in my movie.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
It's more like your attitude. Your tone, your speech patterns demonstrate a certain confidence in yourselves, in your opinions, your indifference to conventional views.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
Martin, look at me.
That's not bad.
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
A couple days ago by, people from the airliner come to see his wife, tell her how sorry they are and all that their plane exploded and offer her a settlement, the amount based on what he would've earned operating the dry cleaner's the rest of his life. Leo had some kind of trouble with his kidneys, so they were giving him about ten years.
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
Yeah. When you turn to the camera to tell the alien mother that her time on earth is finished... when you give us all that look, Joan Crawford wishes on her best day she had that much presence. Not even in "Mildred Pierce" -– which by the way was a better book than a movie -– did Crawford even touch the intensity you had in that look.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
Man, can you scream.
Then you've read it?
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Harry, what're you doing? You're supposed to be in the hospital.
It's not Dave. It's a movie.
Are you going down?
Hey, Chili.  Get your coat, but don't piss the guy off, okay? It could get complicated and we'd have to call Momo to straighten it out. Then Momo gets pissed for wasting his time and we don't need that.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
All these camera moves and weird angles and shit are gonna distance us from the emotion of the scene.
Hello, Doris.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Harry -–
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Hi, sweetface. You look great. And mmmmm, you smell good, too.
North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention.
They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
You think that's funny
Out here? What, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of Spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
Ready?
Pretty handy with that scatter gun, Epps. You raised on a farm?
You aren't jealous, are you Dodge?
You have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? The fittings alone could go for a few million.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
How long to fix?
The right way and the wrong way.
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Didn't happen yesterday, I'll tell you that. Torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
Dodge to Murphy.
Murphy.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!
What the hell happened!
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
That's what I call a payday.
Any dizziness?
Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
The guy. He just came this way.
Epps.
The ah... the radio's out.
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
But where's the damage?
It's not gonna hold us.
Not our mystery guest again.
Too deep to anchor out there.
How's that?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
I don't know.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
How're you feeling?
We ain't exactly in what you'd call your high traffic neighborhood either.
A what?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Not the Maxine?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
Are you going to yell at me?
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
And what can you tell us about this... 
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
In answer to your question, I suppose I endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Yeah, right...
Yeah, well --
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Hi Enid.
Why?
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
Which loser?
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
It's obviously him!
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
How about this?
That guy is totally amazing.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Like what?
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
You're gross.  See that guy?
You're just jealous.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
What thing?
Hello?
What happened to Seymour?
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
So what are you guys doing this Summer?
Shhh!
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
You're crazy -- it should be like two dollars!
NO!!!
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
Good luck...
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
Every guy has a type!
So is that your boyfriend?
I - I'd really rather not...
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
Jesus...
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Wow, this is so cool...
What are you, a fry cook or something?
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
Oh yeah?
So, what happened?
I know, I'm sorry... I-I've been really busy...
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
I dunno... okay, I guess...  I fucked that guy Josh finally...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
...I better not...
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
What's her problem anyway?  Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
I'm just being realistic.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
What about Joe?
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
So where would we go?
What do you want?
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah.
What do we have here, Margaret?
Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why? What did she tell you?
That slut!
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
I am a man of peace.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
And it worked?
I'm going to try and locate Redbeard- I assume you've heard of him.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
Anything special about them?
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
I'm sure you mean that to be comforting, but-
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
With much more on the way-  -John- we could have had this chat on flatter ground-
That's very considerate.
The best way to ensure the kill when you're using trackers is for one to shoot while the other uses the trackers to force the lion toward the shooter. Have you ever led trackers?
Goddammit!
How many do you think they've killed?
I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad you came.
Do you love her?
Some mysteries should not have solutions.
Janosz?
Dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Oh no.
Occasionally
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when I left.
Oh, hello, Peter.
Thank you.  Poor baby.  I think I should put him down now.
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Sorry!
Look, I've had it with you.  Get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  This is a city matter and everything's under control.
It's that darn ghost again!  I don't know what to do anymore.  He just won't leave us alone.  I guess we'll just have to move.
Motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  I'd like to have a baby myself. Wouldn't you?
Should we go?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You pitiful, miserable creatures!  You dare to challenge the power of darkness?  Don't you realize what you are dealing with?  He's Vigo!  You are like the buzzing of flies to him.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
That's a thousand million electron volts.
Seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
Is the line sinking?
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Nowhere -- fast.  Why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
What's that?
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
And now you're going to eat it?
I hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
She's moving!
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Oh, Dana, it's you.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
Hello.  I'm Peter Venkman.  May I help you?
Uh-huh.
Damn!
Great rehearsal.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Really!  Is it gone?
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
Has this ever happened before?
Great!  How's it going?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
Mr. Mayor, it's a pretty simple choice. You can believe Mr. Pecker here ...
That's "Peck!"
Circle?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
Yes?
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Why not?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
All right.  I'll try.
You know, Peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
Looked at with your eyes.
What is it?
Why don't I check out the building?  It may have a history of psychic turbulence.
They will.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Ray -- Something's here.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Me, too. Parts of the Bible are great.
They hate me, they really hate me don't they?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
For the gods, spit it out!
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
That's difficult to say, general.
You and my father have become very close.  Perhaps one day I may say the same for us.
Caesar?
The army is a problem.  They love you.  You have led them from victory to victory in the name of Rome and they love you.  And after all, you're just a hothead acting from a misguided sense of loyalty -- who could fault you for that?  Thus have I reached a compromise with the Senate over your fate: instead of executing you, I'm sending you to Rome where you will be tried...
Endorse me in public.  Do that and I'll make you rich and set you free. I'll return your estates.  I know you would give anything to be outside again.  Endorse me and you will be free.  Think of it.  What would you do with your freedom?
You won an impossible fight.  You got the attention of the crowd, legate...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
The Senate too?
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
Sneaking around with your brother?
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I came here to see that you stay alive.  The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
Would that Marcus had lived.
Where are they?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
The Senators admire you.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
I was summoned.
It's my job to keep my job.  And that, by the way, is now head of Praetorian Guard.  Good ole Tribuus has been retired.
What are you fighting for in here? The good of Rome?  I can end this madness now!  Take the job for the sake of the Gods, live!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
Quintus is overly idealistic.
Legate Narcissus Meridas, general of the Spanish Felix Legions!  I'm proud to have you in my school!  Now, show them what you can do!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Do you know what you're going to do?
But could I just tell you this one thing?
Wait a minute.
Where we going?
Yes.
What's the matter?
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
GET OUT!
Where are you meeting this person?
I've never been to it.
Is that him over there?
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
But Elaine --
Benjamin?
But you might.
I don't know.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Carl who?
Yes.
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
657-2036
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
It's in the main ballroom.
A single room or a double room?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
What?
Sir?
What?
Why not?
Her portrait?
Yes?
Oh. Well, goodnight.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
What are you so scared of?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
Why don't you get it.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
To tell you?
Well.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Either one will be fine.
Is this -- what?
If you want.
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Now let's keep going here.
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
No we don't.
Not exactly.
Well I can't.
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
Why are you asking me all this?
Good.
But why shouldn't I?
Benjamin?
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Don't start acting hurt.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Where is Elaine?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Very good, sir.
Sure.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
I do.
No -- they don't.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
That has nothing to do with it --
No. She doesn't know about it.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
You'll never be young again.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
HUH?
Is anything wrong?
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
How?
I'll pay you back.
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
Yes -- tired...
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
You are beautiful!
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
So --
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
And now?
Do you understand?
Grusinskaya --
You do believe that I really love you?
I'll go -- good-bye.
Very early in the morning.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why do you think --
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Oh -- but -- I --
What, Doctor?
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
Please -- please!
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Oh yes, of course.
I'm the stenographer.
You pay me.
What?
No -- now.
I must go to England -- at once.
A thousand marks -- 
What?
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
Sorry, Preysing. 
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Let us cancel the engagement.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
Take them back, Suzette.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
He will be on the train.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Me?
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Just one moment, sir.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
No. No word.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
What you need is some relaxation.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
You wanna talk to me straight up?
My son --
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
I'll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet. Faces the desert.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
It's not your fault.
Well, uh... No.
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
They knocked out my tooth!
Sure.
Expecting visitors?
I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
You're dead, Lilly, it worked.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
) That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
You're too young. You should be in school.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I'll sign that affidavit.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
The tap. What you do for a living.
The long end. Big con.
Nobody does that single-o.
And when he got serious?
Upstate.
Atascadero.
You were gone for a while.
She didn't see you, in other words.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
And hello to you, too.
I realize this is a shock.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Why am I here?
Impressive, Blake.  Where'd you learn how to do that?
The cemetery...
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
No shit?!
My office?
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
You stole it?
You saw that Michael Meyers display.  You've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
It's John, isn't it?
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  Need anything?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
Wait.
Ooooh, busted.
No, Mom -- keep it on!
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Where's the baby?!
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
There's more people moving eastbound down Old Reservoir Road past the elementary school.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
What's wrong?  What's happened to Jamie?
Where's the child?
This is madness, Wynn.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Jamie's baby ...
Samhain.
No!!!
Who else knew I had the baby?!
No one.
I suppose.
You know what gets me?
You know what gets me about that Cadillac?
You ever own a motorcycle?
First Nagasaki--now this.
Oh.  I'd forgotten.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
Hi, Penelope.
What's this?
Me?
Everybody thinks that.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Blue soup.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
I've considered that.
What?
Ask it!
Even this--"Herb Shuttle", you said?
She met him at college.
College?
He insults him all the time.
Excellent!
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
I saw your father fight Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, hand to hand.
I don't know.
Mhravitch.  Remember that name.
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Tomorrow's another day. PAUL You know what my English literature teacher said about you?
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
We've got to do something to make this boy's voice change.  I wonder if we couldn't get bull balls somewhere, and fry 'em up.  Still miss your mother?
Nothing.
No.
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
It's your house, Dad.
"Hamburger Heaven."
I'm engaged.
What do you do for a living?
Disease?
We thought a doctor might help.
Harold!
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
Let me guess--breakfast is served?
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
I don't think so.
Did you like it, dear?
Two hundred years old.
Well--what have we here?  A family.
Just one favor.
Testimonials of that sort are--are beyond my range.  I don't do them well.  That's a failing, I know.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
But it's all balled up in your head with death.  The highest honor is death.  When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them.  You honored them with death.  Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
I want you to get out of here, Norbert.  Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Ah!  You're ambulatory!
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
I've never heard of it.
Are you've seen it work cures?
We have, have we?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
Now who's being cruel?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
Don Quixote.
Here.  Finish the job.
I'm utterly satisfied.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Can't do it.
What are you going to do?
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Alice is dead?
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.
I'm only ten years old.
That is sad.
Don't!
A lot of people don't.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
Who have you been talking to?
That's something I suppose.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
If you'll pardon the expression, that's when you'll see the fur and feathers fly.  Good night.
What then?
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
How nice.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
You and Harold are friends?
We've got to rescue him.
We met here earlier this evening.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Do it!
You think you're so funny.  You're not even funny.  Right?  Right?  You don't hurt yourself if you start out slow.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
Big threat. TV would ream you.
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
No, that would be much too overpowering.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
The other girl is the star?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Huh?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple of months ago.
At least I'm a growing person.
You know what I'm talking about.
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
I don't see why I must justify myself to you. I don't care about the things you do. I don't care what's happening in New York or Los Angeles. I don't care about movies or TV. I don't care who's on Johnny Carson.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
Fuck.
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
What makes you so sure?
Why do you say that?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
But then you'll forget about me.
If I was you, Mr. Mast, I'd watch my language.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
No.
They are?
You sure as hell haven't been any help.
What happened?
What plan?
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
Where is she? Where is the girl?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Yeah.
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Hold it, mister.
You know Granville's looking for you, Niki?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
Could I see your registration?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Took it?
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
What do you want?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
But this is my car.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
What is it?
Why not?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
What's that?
No.
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I don't know.
The ice is melting.
It's all right.  It's organic.
You are the wisest person I know.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Maude, I must speak to you.
Don't you advance on me.
I don't know. Perhaps.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
You should have been a poet.
- end where I began.
Maude.
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
I have a sore throat.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
What?
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
Why?
And a lot of time.
No.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Jeez! That's a great story,
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Well, I don't...
Stay where you are, Harold .
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Frank.
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
He... he loved me.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
What is this? Someone else you think escaped us, like Frank?
What was it, kid? Smack? Angel dust? Don't tell me acid's back in fashion?
The past, the future, whatever this object holds.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
I have seen ghosts, Whitman.
It's almost over!!
Grigory -- That's Russian, right?  Thought they were on our side...
What the hell was that? An ape?
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
A 16th century statue was destroyed. Saint Dionysius the Aeropagite.
Reliquary --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
It's her choice --  She's human --
1958, the occult war finally ends when Adolf Hitler dies.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Names hold the power and nature of things. Mine for example. Rasputin: "The crossroads."  And crossroads I have become.  Your true name: Anung-un-Rama. Repeat it. Become the key.
What are you trying to say?
Helping you -- I just --
Hey. You: think twice --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Okay, someone's expecting us. Turn on your locators -- Anyone sees anything...
You fucking ass-holes.
Want to buy a bed?
Eh, Chas, slow it down like the man says.
Uh-huh.
This isn't happening.
One last time. Give me the box.
This isn't happening.
You bastard --
There is going to BE a wedding?
Don't look at me.
Help me.
Hurting.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty.
Kirsty? It's very late.
I have to see my father.
No, damn you --
Maybe somebody changed the lock.
How long since you were here?
You're still blaming me.
Take it slowly.
Larry....
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Well, isn't it?
I... suppose so, yes.
Do you care ?
No, not much.
No personal details?
What's going on?
What happened to me?
I called another friend of mine and he's coming over. Will you let him in?
Where are you?
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Upstairs.  Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
I want to see.
No you don't.
No. It's all over.
Need any help?
If there's a train.
I beg your pardon?
Steve. Thank God you came.
What did I say?
'Bye.
What are you doing?
Oh, so what's the point then?
What did he ever do to you?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here.  I don't understand any part of this conversation.  You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen.  What am I supposed to say?
Hey.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
So?  You even said they're good.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Sonic Death Monkey.
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Nothing.
We work there!
Anna.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Nice friend.
Yeah.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Are you all right?
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Laura?  Are you okay?
Shit!
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
I haven't felt like it.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
I guess.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
Me?
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Do you want me to be there?
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
I don't want to go back.
When are you going back?
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
C'mon.  I want to know.
How?  How were we the same people?
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Hey.  It's Liz.
What difference does it make?
Is Ray going?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Which way are you going?
That way.
I'll call you.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Hello?  Anybody there?
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Would you like more tea?
Have you spoken to anyone else about this?
This is against the rules.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
Tradition.
I'm a historian, Mr. Taupin. Only once in a lifetime do you stare history in the face.
What's all that?
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Why are you here?
Sometimes innocents become involved.
You kill with your left hand?
What is it like?  Being you?
You have lived forever.
Forgers do it all the time.  They take the birth certificate of some- one who died young and use it to get legit I.D.  Usually they carry it long enough to pass some bad checks then dump it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What are you going to tell them?  That you're protecting a man who's killed four people?
All fashionably without heads.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Never take up poker, Detective.
You talked to your supervisor lately?  He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight.  That on top of the cops bugging him.
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
-Auditorium nostrum-
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
Aye.
You're a long way from Inverness.
He told me there could be only one.
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
Why does he want to kill me?
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
I am a small player.  But if by helping you I can keep that monster from being the last, then perhaps my life has meant something.
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Who am I deceiving?
Romirez understood.  Not you.
Finish your prayers?
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Stay out of it.
Your grandfather wore that in his service to the King, and I to fight for the Duke.
Yeah.
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
He knows I'm here.  How?
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
Long time.
Run!
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
We have some unfinished business.
No.
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you?
The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
His only kid.
Same.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
I'll keep you in mind.
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
But --
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
I'm sure you haven't any.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Oh.
Attaboy!  Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
What do you want?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
Just what I said. That's what I --
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
Dead?
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Get away, Svengali.
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
The insurance business?
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
We're not interested.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Hildy!
How much do you want on it?
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Will you come here?
Murder, uh?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Flip a coin.
Walter!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
I can't.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Five hundred dollars.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you?
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
Huh?
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
What good'll it do?
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
Baldwin -- his name is.
I know.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
No, she didn't.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
You want to join our gang?
Bugger off.
Sod.
They've got the real thing outside.
It's like telling fibs.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Where?
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
And Jim.
You know it? It must be an old one.
He always knows.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
Is it peace in out time?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
We did the decent thing.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
What?
What about R.J.?
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Who's your Daddy!
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
Oh. Maybe R.J. got into a crash and killed everbody?
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
Wondering what?
What?
What the hell are you laughing about?
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
He walks, duh.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Great story Goober, how much?
What's this?
The Duke?
I figured that much. Why the fuck you asking so many jackass questions for?
I don't.
Really? Huh, I thought for sure you'd say Lynette Fromme. She's got that snooty vibe I know you dig.
That reminds me of a film I saw once of a guy who got out of his car at Lion Country Safari to take a picture of a lion cub and got eaten by the lions.
Oh, don't worry she didn't get offended by what I said. You two got to lighten up... right, Bill?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.
Honk at him. Scare him.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Check this out.
What are you doing!
Come on, get with the facts.
I... I got back a stack today. Some nice shots.  See, a good topless June Wilkinson... unfortunately she personalized it...  to Stucky, love June.
That's nice.
How long is that gonna take?
Tickets for what?
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
I don't know, I just thought it was interesting.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
I resign.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Don't even say it.
You got to be fucking joking.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Huh?
Open up the trunk.
Oh, right.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
Great. I thought I felt a certain attraction between Mary and Tiny soon as he walked in.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'm gonna go ask him.
Well hello, officer.
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
I um... no, I don't think so...
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Mr. Willis?
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
No "buts." Go to your room now.
And?
I don't know why you didn't tell me about this.
Like father, like son.
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui. Perfect!
No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant.
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Oui.
Shall we close up, then?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Stop. Get away.
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Yeah? What?
I've moved on.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Oui.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley.
Shut up and tell me.
My brother is discreet.
Three foot one.
And I think I'm going to.
Please, honey, let me in.
Your brother should have his license revoked.
I'll be in touch.
As do I.
Where?
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
Paper or cloth?
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
Who from work?
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Good. Making progress.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
I'm just preoccupied.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as what womanly things?
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
You were gone a long time.
So he's doing okay?
I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Yes?
Mm hmm.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Give me a bottle of beer.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For whom and for what?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
How much?
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Cut.
Yeah? Why?
Pool.
You bet he knows how.  You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
Thanks for the drink.
To do what?
Hey, wait.  What are you gonna do about the money?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
How good is he?
Hey, Findley's here.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I got time, Bert.
You want me to tell her for you?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Findley.
Now and then. Why, do you?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Here.  Been an interestin' evening.
Half and a dollar.
Gimme ten bucks.
How much you playin' for?
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Try me.
Call it.
You better not miss, friend.
What time does the bus leave?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Eggs. How do you like them?
No, why should I? It's yours.
What are you writing?
Would he know?
Is he a winner?
Well, what's so funny?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Leave now.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Fifty-seven.
He went off someplace.
California. Oakland.
That is not now, human!
Yes.
How much do you remember?
When you're here, in the city, where do you live?
What?
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you mean?
Mine.
Have you looked inside?
What's inside?
What's that, Dad?
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
What did it look like?
What did he talk to you about?
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
May I ask why?
I'm not particularly interested, <u>Ms.</u> Magnuson, in what you think is correct. My wife and I are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want Jimmy with us.  Keep him in your office until we arrive.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
Did you call the State Police?
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.
George, where have you been?
What's the story on Jimmy Gardner?
You're being paranoid.
I take it you've heard.
Better be. You left me for him.
Love was never our problem.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What the hell is this?
Did you try to switch to transponder channels?
There's good news and bad news.
What're you talking about?
A countdown to what?
Then what?
Dad, don't start.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
They don't know this.
What the hell is that?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?
What'd I say?
Oh shit, we're late.
Is my wife in the air?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We've been collecting planes from all over but...
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
Well, er... it's slowing down.
You can't go. Call them back.
Dick-weed!
Was his father stationed here?
I don't need it.
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
How' he doing?
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Your treat.
Dad?
It's Dad's Grail Diary. Every clue he ever followed. Every discovery he made. A complete record of his search for the Holy Grail. This is his whole life. Why would he have sent this to me?
Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
What?
Indy! Henry! Follow met I know the way!  Haaa!
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Nazis?! -- Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.  The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
My room!
At least I let you tag along.
No. You like the way I do things.
Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
It's important!
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
If only I could have been with you.
I ought to tell you something.
And the chair.
What?
What final challenge?
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
Well... I can't think of anything.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!
You call this archaeology?
Why are you trying to kill us?
And why were you trying to kill me?
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Now what about the antidote, Lao.
Wow! Holy smoke! Crash landing!
Step on it, Short Round!
Indy?
What you look at, Indy?
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
You were caught trying to steal the Sankara Stones.
Two are still missing.
It is Pankot Palace that kills my village.
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
You all right?
And then they took their children.
Indy! Help me!
Hurry, help me out of here! What're you waiting for?!
What?!
PET IT??!!
THE WHAT?!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Get -- the -- bug -- off!
Oh no -- oh no!!
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
What is it...?
I'm going down.
This is the first time anybody ever cried when I left.
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Where are you,...Al?
Who?
Your name is Al...
Where are we?
Are you threatening me?
Of course you do!
You're not crazy. Don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
Yeah.
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
I did. I brought you back here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
I don't like the sound of that.
Just walk down the hall?
Take a left and your next right.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
That's not a good idea.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You need ID in there?
Anything...A feeling...a smell..?
What is it?
What about money?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
You eat it.
Why not?
.
What?
Yeah. I did it.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Follow that busboy.
They're all in it.
She's the toughest to read.
What is it, your charm?
You're doing great with her.
Is that all?
It's not your time. I get time off.
Some agent you are.
Better. I found Ryuji.
On what?
One of your instincts?
Don't touch a thing.
He was with Gruner!
Are you alright?
Aim just in front of his face.
Keep thinking.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
It's a long story.
If there is a POD inside him, We'll find it, and bring it out for study.
We'll have to let them go.
Well what?
Oh....Sure.
You'll feel better
Joe.
What?
Nothing.
Then who did?
What do you do about what?
You mean from it.
You again.
Me still. They left you alone?
It's not apparent.
As if your mind's not all there.
That you're not crazy.
You talk to yourself.
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Who do you work for?
Is that Ryuji?
Joe! What happened to you?
They kidded me a little.
What did you tell them?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
He must be a good friend.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
And Dieter.
Where we going?
Are you alright?
Looks like they can. What did they do?
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.
Don't worry.
Why not, what are you going to do?
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
Now what?
Do something!
Come on.
He wants to apologise.
Yeah...I have to get away.
What could you find in this place?
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
A drink...
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Just one. The back up.
Tear it apart?
Right there.
The other working.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
How long?
Push it.
Alright, alright.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
I'm afraid you are.
What about you, you got a crew already?
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
You're sure you want to do this?
Lowell?
What's going on?
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Yeah.
I think what we're trying to tell you is that it happens all the time. This is a news organization. People are always telling us things they shouldn't. We have to verify if it's true and in the public interest... And if it is, we air it.
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
I'm going to tell you why. Because when I tell someone I'm going to do something, I deliver.
Please to explain, why I should agree to interview... with pro-Zionist American media?
I know what I have to know.
Doesn't CBS have confidentiality agreements, Mr. Bergman?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
It was on C-SPAN. Yeah.
Is that why you became a journalist? Then you get to ask all the questions?
You believe that?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
Some public relations guy got a hold of a tape of an interview... where you're saying you were on the American Judo Team in the Olympics...?
What does this have to do with my testimony?! I told the truth! It's valid and true and provable!
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
You try and have a good time.
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
You're gonna get your fix...
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Most certainly.
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Hello.
You threatening my family, now, too?
Well, I wouldn't say --
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
What the hell is Botox?
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I have it.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I assume this is on Rex?
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
He wants a reconciliation.
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Marylin! Listen to me.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
Thank you.
Hmmm...
She held that against you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Did you just propose to me?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
Good.  Are those foods?
Fabric and fringe.
What do you want?
I want to nail you ass.
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
You have to leave the house immediately!
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
Murder!
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Ha Ha.
...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars...
And it's good!
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
What's Kirshner?
In anticipation of making you sick.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
HA!
What...?
No. I haven't. But I've been out of town.  Hello, Rex. Hello there.
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
That's an evasion.
Do you love her?
You ought to know why. Because—
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
Ellie—
Oh, yes. I heard.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
She hasn't had a thing yesterday—or today.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space.  Goodbye. 
They're practically all the same, sir. 
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
Oh, yeah?
Driver!
I beg your pardon!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Yes.
My ticket?
What are you talking about?
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
That's none of your business.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Do you mind putting out the light?
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Hurry up and get dressed.
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Well, take them off.
was—but—
What are you thinking about?
Raw?
You think it's simple, huh?
Clever.
Amazing.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What for?
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Why not? I'm hungry.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
ONE—TWO—THREE—FOUR—FIVE
No harm in your coming to see us.
How are you, Ellie?  Are you happy?
Yes—if he is your husband.
But can't you wait until morning—
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
What time is it?
The dame's too smart for him.
Mr. Gordon—
Huh?
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve.  Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that—
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Yeah.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn—then something comes along—messes up the finish—and there you are.
I ain't got a hat.
They made me get 'em a rope and a blanket, on a night like this.
What do you reckon that's for?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Collect?
Wife?
That's right.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Yeah ?—How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Orange, New Jersey.
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
What was his voice like?
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
I'm just an investigator, Bill.  I leave the theories to you lawyers.
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
Yeah.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
No, I never saw him before in my life.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
Black, black - just give it to me.  Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had it for years.  I been working with mice, y'know, trying to come up with a cure.
You make it sound like some remote fuckin' experience in ancient history. Man, you never leave the Agency. Once they got you, you're in for life.
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
That's our case!
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you think I would be here today... talking to somebody like you?
In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that...
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing.  Oswald did badly on the test, he says.  "He only had two more Russian words right than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me saying Touchdown here...  ...is not very intelligent because I beat him three games out of five the last time we played chess.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
That's not why I'm attacking him! You don't believe me - all this time you never believed me.
They killed him, honey.
Oh no!... How bad?
Post Office.
What are you driving at, boss?
...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
When are you going back to Washington, sir?
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
Who?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Well, it ain't so much a problem a a situation. Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got?
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
She knows it's my case?
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it. You forgot or what? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine, plus two years in prison. Now you want to talk to us about it, or you want to talk to Customs?
I'm not a loser.
What's this?
That doesn't sound dark.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Was she helpful?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
I wrote him on Monday. They found him dead on Tuesday.
It was the other guy who busted me.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Cash poor?
You get a chance to use it?
This is pretty.
Who is this?
Well, if the A.T.F. guy is the one who wants you, that'll only interest him up to a point.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
It's not really something I think about.
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
He tries to act cool.
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
The day you got me out of jail?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
What do you do when he comes home?
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
How'd you find out?
Ray wants him.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
Set him up.
Less ten percent.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
We'll just be a minute.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
Bank robbery? Do you know what he does for Ordell?
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
She didn't say.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.
You didn't count it?
Uh-huh.
After all, it don't belong to nobody, right?
I'm waiting for the phone.
He said he didn't know about it.
I knew it.
How the fuck they know that?
Who?
If you want.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
And they follow the wrong one thinkin' she's bringing it to me.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Plus the same deal as before.
Designer clothes.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I can sit through it once.
Two months shy of four years.
Uh-huh.
You okay?
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
You're fourteen years old here?
I thought you were sixteen.
No.
With Ordell?
I don't like dancing.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
He put himself in a situation where he was gonna have to do ten years in the penetentiary, that's what he did.  And if you know Beaumont, you know there ain't no way in hell he can do no ten years. And if you know that, you know Beaumont's gonna go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass. Now that, my friend, is a clear case of him or me. And you best believe it ain't gonna be me. You know what I'm sayin'? You gonna come in on this with me, you gotta be prepared to go all the way. I got me so far over a half-a-million dollars sittin' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas. Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery, I'm gonna have me over a million. You think I'm gonna let this little cheese eatin' nigga here fuck that up? Shit, you better think again. 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up, I'll shoot that nigga in the head, and ten niggas look just like em.  Understand what I'm sayin'?
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
Well, she keeps saying 'in a minute.'
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
So what, you left her there.
Where did you shoot her?
In the chest and stomach.
What?
How much it there?
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
How long was she in there?
That's right.
What'd you shoot her with?
Yeah.
You have cash. What do you need me for?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Will they consider this a violation of his probation?
She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess.
Hear what?
Beaumont worked for you.
Was she?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
And you did that to protect my interest?
She's been there since Thursday night.
She was afraid.
You expect me to just walk in there?
Turn left.
Ha-ha-ha. I'm serious, you smoke too much of that shit. That shit robs you of your ambition.
Cherry Bail Bonds.
He ain't here right now.
Home?  This is your home. You're dead.
I see.
What do you want?
Well, how do I look?
Grass never did that to me.
Daddy!
You're hurting me!
Daddy. Let go.
I could have told you that.
Short? It's ended.
They're not interested, Jake.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
... I've seen them, too.
How do you know?
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
She talk about the boys?
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
God almighty. What did you do to me?
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Whataya mean, no record?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
She had these real beefy thighs. Delicious.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
I didn't want to wake you.
The room!
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
You're a real heathen, you know that, Jezzie? Jesus, how did I ever get involved with such a ninny?
That's Sarah?  I can see what you mean.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
How high is that?
Get your clothes off.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Coming here?
Help me! Help me!
It's just me.
Stay away from me, Jez.
It might be for me.
How?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Me neither.
No. Things are too hot. Later. I'll send for you.
I promise.
Please.
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Who are you? What are you doing to me?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
You've lived with me for two years.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
West.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
Where have they gone?
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Shows how much you knew.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
None of us can remember that night. I get flashes of it but they don't make sense. We saw shrinks for years. But nothing they did could ever touch it. What happened? Was there ever an offensive?
I think I'm falling asleep.
I can't move.
I would have stayed there if I could.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
I don't know what to say.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Speaking.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
Shit, Paul. I'd love to see you. But I'm kind of laid up here. I've been sick.
It's almost like a conspiracy, huh?
That black car?
I've seen them too ... the demons!
God almighty. I thought I was the only one.
Died?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
Is he all right?
Yes it does.
What are you doing?!!
Minimal.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Shit!
As long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
My god! This is way over your head, pal. We need to call some experts and . . .
Jesus what the hell is that?
What the hell are you doing?
Kicker, anything?
Pull me in!
Rizzo?!
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
It's time.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Yuck.
Push off toward us.
Close the fucking door!
Now this is getting exciting.
I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
I don't know...sorry?
Ow!
Kay-Em, you okay?
Azrael can you repeat that?
How do you open the damn door?
Just a favor for your old man.
My cars. And a comic book.
What?
You got it.
And you get the Mayor off my back with this zoning crap. Nobody tells me how to run my property.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's trying to sink us!
He's comin' up -- !
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
You'd love to prove that. Getting your name in the National Geographic.
I was acting in the town's best interests...
Rogue?
What stinks so bad?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What happened?
You all right?
What the hell?
Christine what?
I didn't know her.
I agree. If she's going to advertise, I wouldn't recommend out-of-town papers. Amity people could take care of this.
Twenty years.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
20 feet, if it's an inch...
Bull shark scraped me while I was taking samples...
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Thanks for the message.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
So that's cool with you, then?
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
You're being really immature.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I was just bored. I only think school is awesome like, 80% of the time.
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
Can we make out now?
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, God...
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
I'm a junior.
What? My eyes are not lying!
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
When was this, like '96?
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Wow. That shirt is working hard.
Is Vanessa here?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I'm going to say I'm 104% sure.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Yeah, she does.
You mean like couples?
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
You're not listening to me.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Hly shht!
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
Keith's hot.
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
...Pardon?
That's me.
Carryin' a gun.
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
What's up Adele? Dinner ready?
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Early, what're you doin'?
What's your name, boy?
Turkey mostly.
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
So tell me... what happened here?
...just like that?
So how's it going?
Who said he's my good buddy?
What is it?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
Any word from that gallery?
Not yet.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
You were plenty hot.
...The police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. And no doubt God'll be pickin' on you on Judgement Day...
What is it?
Well it took me longer than I thought it would take. It took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. But once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. It hurts the first time.
You could tell she took care of herself. She had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
Yeah.
I want to knock her guard down. I mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. Having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Yep.
Who?
Oh. You like her?
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
So.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Good luck?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
Nah.
Why not? You stink.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Nothen' B.
Right here.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
You have?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
You were?
Come on. It'll be fun. We'll just bug out. There should be a bunch of people. It'll be fun I promise.
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
What do I want to do?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
Everything is wrong.
Yeah, I guess so.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Do you know where he went?
Yeah. And sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
Yeah.
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Mom.
Shh.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
So, how many people live here now?
I don't know, eight or nine.
Slow.
Right.
Yeah.
What kind of problem?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
He says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  Why not come back then and listen for yourself.
Meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
What do you mean, no?
Yes you are.
Debi Rutlege.  Female.  Caucasian. Twenty four.  Worked over at the Four Oaks Hotel.
You alright?
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I've figured out the message.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I know where you are.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Who told you that?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
Same as the others?
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
Before we go in I gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
What time did he get there?
No.  He was wearing a mask... but I saw the cut on his wrist.  It was Peter.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
What have you come up with on the riddle?
A building?
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
You have something you want to say?
Just thought you might want to talk.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
I can check and call you back.
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
What are you looking for?
I can't right now.  I've got a game.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
It wasn't intentional.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
I just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  Let me ask you something?  Do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
I'm sorry.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
What's wrong?
Frank told me.
You're going to be late for your match.
Are you going to come tonight?
Hello, Peter.  You played an interesting game last night.  Even though sacrificing your Queen at b-5 is the game I played against Valsney in '82.  I'm glad it helped you.
Oh. That.  I know what you mean.  I had nightmares all week.
Me too.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I lied.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
The White Castle has fallen.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
The Fortress moves?
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Then we must be ready. Five leagues from here is the Eastern Tower. I know the Barons who hold it. Good men, and brave. They will help us.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
I'm not sure.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
My <u>friend</u>.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
Forgive me, my friends. I saw terrible things.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
I have a cinnamon bar.
You do?
I'm hungry.
I don't think it's working.
Would you desert your friends?
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
He will come for me.
You know the voice.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
You had a son.
Do not try your trickery on me!
Knowledge.
It will not help.
Why do you want to know?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Well, I don't need them...
What, for example?
Rocket launcher.
Who'll I aim at?
You were scared, weren't you?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
...You don't believe me, don't you?
Mathilda?!
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
No, excuse me... It's the yogurt that made me laugh.
Nothing, for the moment.
I don't know... Five minutes.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
Don't fear.
...And how much is it?
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
...Who sent you?
Is he still alive?
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Maybe one day -- after you've been married twenty years you'll understand.
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
What would you like us to do?
Are you a preacher?
Pardon?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
I do love you... very, very much.
Face it Ellen, I'm not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. But you love me anyway.
That's a reasonable assumption.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
Shit!  He jumped!
That's me.
Each inch represents 150 miles...
Umm, no.  It's just that --
I want to reach people.  Nobody listens to me.  This is my way to reach them.
When are you leaving?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
Don't do this.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
Where did he go?
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
I've always wanted a watch like that.
This isn't right.
What do you think I should get?
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
Water?
Hello!
Hello.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yes.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Don't you like me, Ben?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
How are you doing?
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
How'd this happen?
I've been all right.
You have been lonely?
A full night on the street and this is all?
I can't tell you.
Was there any reason for you to believe she had discarded a weapon?
Did you hear a shot fired?
Come again?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
What are you talking about?
Sit down.
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
I don't know.
No!
You ready?
So, this is the only interaction you two have ever had?
The idiot speaks.
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
But maybe it's not what you think.
How do you figure?
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Projecting joy is not my job.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Up for a celebration dinner?
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Why not?
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
Amazing how?
Your what?
You're beautiful.
But the thing is, if I'm gonna be a senator by the time I'm thirty -- I can't keep dicking around.
That's not entirely --
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Why?!
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Fire moat... why do that?
What?
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
I am afraid of nothing.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
Oh, yes...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
It's nothing.  My men take great delight in routing the enemy.  Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
East of Mercia?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
No... I... I need to rest.
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
And who might that be?
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield.  Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...!  Want to see me do it?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it.  Rest easy, Jack.
Wait!
Is she... dead?
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
Easily spoken...
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Never show mercy!
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Go on... go on...
And did you?
You see!  You see!
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
I'll go search for it.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Grand champion, is it?  And what great cause leads you to me?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
She's dead!
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
Courage, Jack.
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
I'd be honored.
Jest with me then.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
You... you... you mortal you!
Be fair, Oona.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
Is he a friend, then?
Can you show us the way?
To Castle Couer de Noir?
You've been inside?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
When does George get to come see his house?
Oh.
And why was the alarm on?
What are you doing up so early?
He must.
No.
What's today?
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
You look better without make-up.
I can't even take a shower here.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I can use your mom's.
Really?
Why are you so stupid?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
Right...she married...what was he?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Class of eighty-six!  I didn't know you were there.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Sam?
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
You're here early today.
This has got to stop!
I forgot where I put my keys.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
I'm not going!
No.
It bugs me.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I'll have to pay him back.
I took some of your Vicodin.
I know.  Why?
What would you like to be?
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Everything would have been better if you had.  You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother.  I remember reading about her in the paper.  They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
It's okay.
Where is he?
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Kurt's been feeding him.
But you can't call me while you think?
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Where will you live?
The garage.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Do you remember?
With your hands or your tongue?
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
I thought we were helping.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
You've never said that before.
You got any weed?
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Hey.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Go tell your father we're eating.
She's doing just fine.
Don't take it so hard, Biscuit. She don't mean nothin' to him.
Oh, no, Ray. Not tonight. Spanky's not happy with you.
Sharp.
Take care of me?
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Yes, sir.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
What are they gonna do to us?
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
A loan officer?
You need collateral.
That thing? Who'd you steal it from?
Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Guess we better get going, huh?
Still got that ten dollars?
What are you talking about?
He even got my daddy's watch.
He's dead.
So?
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
What'd you say?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
All right, man, just settle down. We'll get outta here, Claude. We'll get outta here real soon.
I know people.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
One of the new kids said they're farming those acres just north of the swamp. He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place.
My daddy died in prison. He gave up hope and hung himself. What you're talking about is the same damn thing. That ain't how I'm going.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
What the hell are you doing in that trunk?!
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
It's too late for plans.
You got your own nightclub?
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
So it don't exist.
Where am I at, man?
What do you think about that?
1932? That's like, that's like...
Ray's special recipe. He always had exacting standards where the hooch was concerned.
They gave me life, mama.
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
I oughta shoot you for that comment, boy.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Who?
What's your name?
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
If I was you, I'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Little Nicky.
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
I lowered the drinking age to ten.
Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I'm gonna bust Adrian's head wide open.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
An angel?
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
You came through, Nicky.
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Bus?
It's Stanley, sir.
Boogerland!
By she, do you mean he?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Please. You got to.
The South.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
Can we go fly over Central Park?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
No cubs over fifteen, Billy! Ever heard of a cub with a green flower? You'll leave Cathedral then, Billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  If you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
Your own work?
I designed it myself.  What'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
I don't care... Just get it over with.
Just wondered... what happens?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Did you ever see Francis-8?
The damned Yellows are getting out of hand. Those three ought to be in Cathedral. No business scrambling in Arcade...
What's wrong, Available?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
Jessica.
No.
I'm not armed.  Well?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
You know.
I'm going to run.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
It's different now. Help me.
I'd rather be with you.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
But what is this -- why?
All right. But why? I didn't kill the Runner.
Because he's my friend --  and I don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
Exactly four steps now. Let me lead you.  Now to the right. It's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
How will they know we're coming?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
Beloved husband...
Is it inside the city?
Are you sure?
A Sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. Where's the doctor?
No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
No, no, no
Too little.
I don't think so.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
Why not?
Maid? Relative?
As best we can.
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
So what do we do?
He works for Mr. Eddy.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Okay...
Where's the bathroom?
Hey.
Have you made any charges against him?
Out in back.
Repeat that, Bill.
Who is it?
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
A videotape.
Same one you were reading the other night?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I can see that.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
Hello.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Yeah.
We just killed a couple of people...
Whatiya mean?
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
I don't want to talk about it...
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Cable from Gainsford.
Fossils, huh?
Uh-huh.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Where are they? Do you see them?
That's what they do with cattle just before the slaughter. Fatten them.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
Certainly not.
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
Yeah. I though you ran this joint.
Think of it! In times like these.
I say, will you have a cigarette?
Pipes? Where are you going to get pipes?
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
Well - I'm—
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business—
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
How do you do?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
They were.
—buy and sell?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
No porters here!!
Yes.
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
He's dead? That's fine. You won't see me shedding any tears over him!  Oh George, you must take me with you!
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago—  —you're still alive, Father Perrault!
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
And be sure that none of the natives get in.
Do try to sleep, Bob.
What are these people?
Did I say "if"?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
I'd go mad!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
Good.
Why, you - you— Look here - he may dash us to pieces!
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Yes.
Thank you.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Why, mother?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
I've thought about it for years.  I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave.  Am I forgiven for sending for you?
What is it?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
So... this door.  It's... not an exit...  ?
You think we're nuts.
Only the damn guy won't know it.
His physics are a little different than ours.  Don't worry
It'll make sense later?
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
Kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
Jesus...
Kay--
How does that help me?
Great.  Fine.  Listen, why don't we call the pentagon, maybe they'll take you back with the new age well wishers.  I'll stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Do his job.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
When?
Let's go, Jeebs.  Downtown.
How could it not?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
Even that little bug you found in Sudbury seems to have taken off.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Where's he making his big speech?
Well, uh... so we can got into things, I guess.
If I may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
No.  Follow him.
He's here.
Oh, God...
I always wondered what the world would be like.  But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more.  It's all right.  Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
Then who was he?
Don't worry.  I could cut open your chest, sew a dead cat in there and you'd never get an infection.  Not with the spectrum of antibios I'll be shooting into you.
And replace them with new ones.
It's all I could safely move.
I put you away --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
What?
I go running down there.
We won't let them.
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
Then come to my house.  We'll talk --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Everybody runs.
Yeah?  So?
What?
As I recall, they outlawed compression firearms in the District ten years ago.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
Flaws.
Just go to the beginning!
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
It's a little late for that.
What the hell.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
You're saying that I've halo'd innocent people?
Where?
-- and then walk out.
Then how did he --
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
We know why John was tagged.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
The man lost a child, for Christ's sake...
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
What?
This is Evanna, the team pilot.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
He looks familiar.
Who?
We could have lunch together.
Raincheck?
I don't have any sugar either.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
You sure? I just made it.
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
What's 'incidentals?'
What, sir?
What if I gave you forty?
I don't get it. What do you do?
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
He's great, right. Is he great?
It's a poison arrow tree frog.
I don't know.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
I want you to quit.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I -- I -- I... Don't...
C'mon girl. Eat up.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
What's that?
This is it.
Why?
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? This ain't a fucking democracy. You want out?
Yeah.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
There won't be a next thing.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah?
Yeah, I'm 5-5 and 1.
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
What happened to boxing? I thought we made a vow.
You wanna go right now?
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Is that the woman from..?
Unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, I don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Forty-six.
Yeah, I guess.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
Don't even start.
You happy?
About what?
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
We're getting whacked.
Eighty five.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
Yeah. Ricky Slade.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
He's on the list.
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Drinks are free, right?
Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
'Strapped?'
You really in trouble?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Ruiz? Oh, he ain't here.
Well, I didn't care for the club much. And, I must say, I didn't care for him either.
Coke?
How's it going?
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.
Yeah.
I never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. I should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but I'll take that up with Ruiz. I made a few calls back East. Those punks weren't tied in with anyone. As for the Welshman, he wasn't in on it. He was just plain dumb. As for you, Ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
But, Max --
What the fuck was you told? Don't talk, right?
And here I thought you flew in some out of town muscle. How's it going, men?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Yes, sir.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
It hit?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
Shit, what else she gonna say?
Take it easy, baby.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
Man, what do you want?
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
Leggo. I got to wash it out.
What you sniffing around for? I told you I gave you your last fix.
Okay, okay.
A black man playing big league ball is something.
Then the devil is white.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
What?
I see your point.
Could we sit down someplace?
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
I'm in Detroit.
What do you think?
I just want to sit here and be still.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
I'm tired of praying.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Are you Elijah's pimp?
What?
Your control over your children, therefore --
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
You the man.
You evil this morning.
You had the number.
Except she live on the hill and got a grandma.
Don't you know, you can't hump the Bogart.
Bang, bang. You're dead.
I ain't doing bad.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
Might be all right.
You want to be the head man?
Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen. Maybe then we'll get somewhere.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
[Where are you coming from?]
[I'm on to Juarez.]
Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos.
[What is his name?]
[What is his name?]
[Drive.]
[Please, don't...]
[Yes. Many times.]
What is it?
I drink.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off.
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Where are you from, Creasy?
The United States.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
Did you like school, Creasy?
Where?
I don't think they're broken. Anywhere else?
You feel sorry for the husband?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Yes.
That's not a question.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Then be trained.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Planned what?
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
What was her name?
Bye, Mom.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
My wife, Mr. Creasy.
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
That's what friends do.
I can take care of myself.
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
It's early.
Who you gonna call?
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Yeah.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Please...
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
Well, I'll tell you. I got stuck on a blind date with a dog, and I just met an old girl I used to know, and I was wondering how I'm gonna get rid of the girl I'm with. Somebody to take her home, you know what I mean? I'd be glad to pay you five bucks if you take her home for me.
Where you going now?
She was always a bit thin in the hips...
That means he'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old.
Sure, what?
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Waddaya talking about, do you know what you're talking about?
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
Sure.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
On accounta...
We didn't tell her anything yet. We thought that we'd leave it to you. We thought you'd put it like how you were lonely, and why don't she come to live with you. Because that way it looks like she's doing you a favor, insteada we're throwing her out, and it won't be so cruel on her. Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you?
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
All right, Ginnie. I don't wanna talk anymore about it.  I don't think I got one hour's sleep the whole night.  Last night was the first time in my life I ever heard my mother cry, you know that?
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
There's sort of a built-in prayer for the sick man to get well, but of course that's not the basic intention.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Yeah, maybe move that nurse in. She don't seem the type to keep you awake praying.
Home.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Look at that right eye.
Where you from with that crazy way of talking?
We've stuck it out for a whole week now... Pretty girl.
And you've had a natural four times in a row in a crap game. Right? Does that mean...?
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
I thought we were heading for trouble putting on all these trinkets.
Let's hear from you, you goddam Yankee. Be nice to see you some time.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
The hell we won't! You bastards pulled something, I don't know what, but we've been beating you without him. Ane we'll go on beating you!
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Now, General, I'm going to sandbag you. Do you think we're ready to get out of this belly?
And there it is.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
...But I turned in my knee pads.
We stand behind all our work.
How about squeezing him through into Dartmouth? If all he wants to do is catch lobsters, he can learn that here.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
What's the matter?
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Something else we have in common.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You please excuse...  I have been making examination of this young man to find if he will be soldier in our army.
I'm sorry to hear that. You think he's unfit for military service?
Second pint.
You really say the cutest things.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks.
You don't go after the local scrunch?
I have but well, you know, I've been mainly an anesthetist a long time now and... well, I'd like you guys to take a look at him.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
What did you have to test, for God's sake... the dental Don Juan of Detroit?
You've been drawn to other males? Since you were a kid?
Morning Painless. How they goin'?
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
But we strongly suspect something will happen to screw up this splendid organization of yours if you don't get that sky pilot out of our tent.
I'll try, d-d-dammit! You can't ask any more than that!
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
You mean who hit who?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Huh?
Are you all right?
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
With all of it?
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Oh. Yeah.
How much money do you get?
Money.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
Oh.
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The letter.
What letter?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
What John Doe?
Who, for instance?
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Hurry up, Pop.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
What do you do when you work?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Sure. Mostly often.
Well, I'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'Course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
Sure, you are.
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
Well, I don't get it.
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
How about family? Got any family?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Why, certainly. With your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
Yes! I was paid! But the—
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
It's good to see you. Sit down.
It's for Ann . . .
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
Have you got the speech I gave you?
Now, look. I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you get started. We'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Where's the stereo?
Apartment 306.
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
What happened, Mike.
I won't get away with it.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Tell my dad.
Automatic.
Did you check out DMV for any vehicles registration?
How about the record room for any incident reports? He might be a victim. We can get medical records. Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
Is that all?
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
They recruited me. Promised me fast advancement.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
You think you can learn, McCall?
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
Yes.
To save lives.
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Ronnie... Yeah, so.
He's cutting down the visibility.
I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Only that floor.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
That a new picture?
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
If you did, you never showed it.
That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much?
Yeah that's it.
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
Roper...
Who's running it!
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
What have you promised them?
Halden, how nice to hear your voice.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
Okay...
Do you believe in miracles?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
You are not a God.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
And what about the reconfiguration?
How long?
Won't be time if he gets access --
What?
Be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
What brings you inside?
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
Yes.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Look, I'm doing mute 'till I have a mouthpiece here who's on my side.
There?
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
It's passing over earth as we speak!  Trajectory coordinates are 009843.
Yeah, right.
NEW POWER COINS!!
IMPACT IN FIFTEEN SECONDS!
As soon as we've taken over the world I'm gonna change my name to Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR Mordant?!
Just shut your gap!
That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
But ya got a Boss.
Poor, yeah.
Boo-Boo.
Whatever you say, Boss.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
What do you mean?
We could lose the deal!
I think Maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
Well...
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
It's a mask.
You could have stopped him.
Would it be painful for you?
Meyer just finished the books.
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Yeah. So who the fuck does?
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
I'm glad ya come.
Tommy tells me that Capone's coming in from Chicago.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Not stupid. Fat.
Conditions have changed. Some people have become too powerful.
Monkeybone?
Olive or eyeball?
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait and see.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Why?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
How'd <u>you</u> get in there?
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
All right. You can come.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
... What are they all doing there?
The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
What pictures?
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
It's unusually quiet tonight, isn't it?
Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Mm hmm.
... And the children thought I should take a trip.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
But it *isn't*?
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
What's this, Diz?
You got worms.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Yeah. Funny--
My friends?
Waiter!
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Diz--
Tunnel?
Hey! We're gettin' married--!
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
What is it?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
*But you never asked me*!
Boy Ranger! The answer to a prayer. Manna from heaven! Didn't know the time of day--!
Y-yes, Jim.
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Washington!
Here they are--I got them. They are all right.
Where were you?
Will the Senator yield?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, why not do it? There's a job for you. Get a Bill started to accomplish it--present it to Congress-- it would be a great experience--
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
Most natural thing in the world!
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
Some committee's got it.
The Steering Committee.
We're over in the House.
On paper?
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
No!
Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Already? All these letters?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
Splendid.
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
Well! You don't say!
You're not going to take your *suit* off!
Well--I haven't needed much law so far--what I'd like to get first is a little common sense--
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
What do you mean? What's going on?
Let's get away from here. 
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Go away, Nosey.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
What do you want, Senator?
Yes--
--in other words, Jim--with this Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the man who goes to the Senate now in Sam Foley's place can't ask any questions or talk out of turn. We must be absolutely sure of him.
Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have hit on something tremendous here. Rather than let Miller or anyone else in at this stage, we simply put blinders on this simple son of nature-- and turn him loose on monuments. He's completely out of the way in Washington, and as Happy says, you make political capital out of it at home.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
I hit him from the floor with everything I knew!
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Since he was born.
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
Are these the articles?
Yes, but I—
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
Yes.
It's wonderful.
Oh, that—
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Look, I can do it!
With pay!
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
You can't come up here!
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Must we have the echo?
He's what?
It's a lie!
Newspaperman?
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Have a drink?
Entertainment?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
I'm Chairman?
We provide opera.
Let him alone.
Mrs. Semple?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Yes, ma'am.
South Dakota - north?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Me, sir?
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
Shall I call the police, sir?
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
But you do therapy?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
Go to hell.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
My guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. Maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... Anyway, I thought we could try an experiment.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
What brought this on?
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
So, is this like a Japanese restaurant?
I'd better get in there.
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
My patient had to leave early.
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
You like me. How come?
What it might take is... doing time.
Don't need it.
I'm trying.
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
What can you tell me about this?
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
I don't know. I barely made it today.
You have the best answer for everything.  You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Be specific.
Painful lymph glands?  Forget fulness... irritability... depression?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
You're upset.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Which show was that?
But...
Oh.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
What did he want you to do?
Really?
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
What?
Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you --
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Skip, that's not much of a secret.
It's not?
Damn! What is your name?
But look at me now...
No... no training.
I've never brought anyone down here before.
Doc!... It's not me, is it?
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
No mortal weapons can kill this creature. He is not of this world.
You know where he's taking her?
And then killing your sister.
I got caught robbing a synagogue. Lots of good stuff in them holy places; churches, temples, mosques, and who's guarding them?
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are no-so-good.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
So your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold --
I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
Two hundred pounds.
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
No, I mean --
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin believe that Hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."
The things that get you excited.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got guts, lady.
I'm your sister.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
She's my sister, actually.
That thing gives me the creeps.
Your mind is so slippery.
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Come on, baby!
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
Sounds good to me.
Doctor Heller?
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
How's your dad?
He'll never make it.
That boy's got talent.
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
What?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
Or talk?
Hi.
I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me home?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
Nothing wrong with being a waitress.
What's your real name?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
You sure that's how you spell it?
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
There's a vague similarity.
I can't.
Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
The who?
Yes, Obie-wan.
So what can I get you?
Oh hi, Mom.
Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!
I use it... to fight evil.
This is bad.
And a social life.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
It's a fine thing to establish policies but, when they don't work, they must be reconsidered.  Granted that you have hurt England, but she is still on her feet.  And to seal off her trade with Europe, what has it cost you?  You have had to rule with an iron hand.  You have turned friends into enemies.  And even at that, the result has only been partly effective.  You have never been able to stop the extensive cheating, smuggling and corruption -- even of your own officials.  But I should think the situation in Spain, alone, would give your policy a minus balance.  You have had to commit a quarter of a million of your best troops against the guerrillas, with no victory in sight. And you have given England a dangerous foothold on the Continent, for her armies.
General Kutusov, feel free to say whatever you like.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
You have my absolute assurance, Your Majesty, that Napoleon does not have the strength to attack St. Petersburg now -- his army is exhausted and ill-supplied, and he would be defeated if he attempted that.
Proceed.
And, what a delightful idea!
I'm glad you like it.
Ah, my dear Napoleon, sometimes I feel that I am not really an Emperor as you are.
Please...
I'm sorry, I was at the theater and I didn't receive your note until I returned to my hotel.
I don't have to tell you of our latest difficulties.
About 5,000 troops.
I'm not insulted.
But, sire, Your Majesty would lay Paris open to being sacked.  The enemy is outside the gates with more than 120,000 men.  Besides this, I left the city under the terms of a treaty and I am forbidden to reenter Paris.
And where is Joseph?
Josephine dead -- how unbelievable! How impossible it is to believe it. She was always physically so strong -- she was never ill a day in her life.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
General Bonaparte?
Come back in an hour.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
Was the trip normal in every respect?
Yes, sir?
When did it start?
How did it spread so quickly?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
And he sent you to me?
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Yes -- what is it?
Go away -- I'm busy.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I thought he would be seeing you before I would, and would give it to you.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
Certainly.
That's all you can say?  What are you talking about?
Now, just a minute.  You have just very clearly implied that there is a reason why Joseph should not give my wife the money which I left for her. I can't possibly allow a remark like that to go without explanation.
My God, what do you think?
And, you, my dear wife, do you find that I resemble my portraits?
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
Alexander and I are friends.  We have reached an understanding.
Come in.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
Yeah.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
Stretch it out.
Fuck, what's his name?
Shut up.  I been trying to tell yo' ass that... Day-Day is my cousin.  They're right there in the back.
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
That ain't the worst part.  Her little sister, Baby D.  She's the one that gets real physical.  But I got a restraining order on her, too.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
You go first.
Wait.
What you see?
You want us to give you a ride?
What are you doing here?
It's locked.
What it smell like?
I can't get jiggy with this shit.  Where is the damn manager?
That the big one, huh?
Today ain't my day.
Where's Craig?
Get on.
If you shut up I'll tell you.  The urgent message is...Drop everything!  Craig is in trouble.  Come quick, don't call.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Ezal!  Ezal!
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?
Take your car.
My back.
Mr. Nasty time?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
What?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
My security people are right next door.
I remember you...in the elevator.
That's right.
Good luck.
You're out of your mind.
I will do no such thing.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
I killed you.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
How am I supposed to get away?
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
No.
I want'to talk to her.
Don't you threaten me.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
All right.
No. Kisses to you.
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Oh, man...
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
What?
My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
You're going to go see her.
No, I know I don't want it cleaned. Get out of here.
Gimme a dollar.
He brought a gun onto the pool deck.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
You're a big girl, huh?
I've got something for you.
You got this under control?
I'm looking for them.
No.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
You killed two men, Ben Harper.
I'll bet.
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
No.
I'll light the lamp.
And the Lord told that man --
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
How do you mean?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
My, that fudge smells yummy!
Don't you hurt her!
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
What?
Now: Where?
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Yes?
O no! Your turn!
Naturally.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
That's mighty brave of you, Reverend.
She'll come draggin' her tail back home.
Harry, what --
Are you through praying?
Somewheres down river! Parkersburg, mebbe! -- Cincinnati! -- One of them Sodoms on the Ohio River.
What?
How can you tell?
Worked like a charm.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Guess I did.
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Who?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
He's dangerous.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
Tell her I'm not here, tell her...
Get outside and watch her house. If you see anything funny call me.
Who? Who did that?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
Dead and gone.
No.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Do you think I did it?
You feel better now, right?
When did you have a nightmare?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Count d'Algout is still asleep.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
Your Highness...
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
If there is anything we can do for you...
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Oh no. No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
At what intervals does he whistle?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
In other words you don't know.
Love to.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Ni-notchka.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Do you like Scotch stories?
Yes.
No... go on.
Go on.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Not white, darling.
...and we won't clench our fist...
...but big.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Now, Swana...
Did I hear something about jewels?
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Months, Swana.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
This will do. 
Can you recommend a restaurant?
It's just a place for workmen.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Where the hell is he?
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
How's the job coming, Bob?
We'll see about that ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Executive clemency ...
Yes ... I got the money.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
How so?
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
Goddamn! How long have we had this fucking dog?!  Two years, he still doesn't come!  We need a dog that looks happy when the press is around.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Sir, the deadline is today.
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
That fruitcake!  What about him?
I had nothing to do with that.  Was he ... in the Ellsberg thing?
Well, why not?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
"Security" is not strong enough.
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Uh, no one, of course, is going to see these tapes, but ...
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
... never complain, never explain, John ...
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Sir?
Put Townsend in Belgium; it's available.
More light, chief?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
Hey ... you'll be able to do it now.
I suppose, "Mister President," you're unhappy that we have not implemented your Domestic Intelligence plan, but ...
Mr. Castro.
My job, unpleasant sometimes, is to know what others don't want me to know.
It is not my practice to spy on the president.  Doctor Kissinger manages to convey his innermost secrets to the world at large on his own.
... But it has never been the policy of this government to accept that. And it is certainly not CIA policy.
The White House.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
I know for a fact that the one with the big tits is a Republican, and she'd do anything for the Party.
So, what's this about, Dick?
... as the old alliances crumble.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
That doesn't matter now, Henry.  The point is, you might lose some of your media-darling halo if the press starts sniffing around our dirty laundry.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
Did you cry when he died?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
You're too modest, Nixon.  You're as evil as I am.  We're both from poor families.  But others pay to feed the hunger in us.  In my case, millions of reactionaries.  In your case, millions of Vietnamese.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
It was illegal, what he did.
Sorry, Dick.  She's a little tipsy.
It's a thing she does.  She talks at night.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
Jesus Christ!
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
Edgar, wonderful to see you.  Clyde ... hi.
Bernstein.
Of them.
There's more ... there's more than just me.  You can't break, my boy, even when there's nothing left.  You can't admit, even to yourself, that it's gone, Al.  Do you think those POWs in there did?
It's not fair, Buddy.  I can take the insults; I can take the name-calling. But I can't take the losing.  I hate it.
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Are you serious?
Dick, you should call Bobby.
I don't want them to love me.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Because ... I have to relax.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
Yes.
When?
Write.  You know, a book.  I'm calling it "Six Crises."  It's a good thing, Rocky -- take some time off to write.
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
I am older.
How fresh is this coffee?
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
Oh yes.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Who's he in trouble with then?
These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money.
No. Probably I don't.
So when was he here?
You think this boy Moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
Yessir.
Yessir. It was punched out.
When is the county gonna start payin' a rental on my horse.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
You gave your word?
No. I found it.
You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you.
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Llewelyn?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
She'll be all right.
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
Llewelyn?! No he ain't.
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
He gave Acosta's people a receiver.
...For instance. I used birshot. So as not to blow the window.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
I could come back then.
You live in that house behind the store?
...If that's the way you wanna put it.
Call it?
Look... I got to know what I stand to win.
You already have the tent?
Never mind.  I want a tent.
Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could.
Okay.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
Well enough.
I'm sorry.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Half.
Sugar?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
What outfit.
Sheriff, I don't...
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
One question, Doctor, please!  You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
What about it?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Do you know who I am?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
I'm sorry.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Umm... yes. Back home.
What?
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Are you and Larry happy?
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
No, Del.
Yes, she is.
Didn't I?
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
I begged him to let me put that on!
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
She called you 'George,' George.
He has no heartbeat!
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
Guess who I saw today.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
Huh?
The fuck you talking about?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
That is so right.
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
...that's a good motto.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
I know that.
Worse... you're in Texas.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Where? Where is she?
Well... I think I saw her soul.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
What doesn't?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
Very graceful. Perfect form.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
What did you say?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
- and share one of your graves.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Yeah, look at me.
Pete have a brother?
What's his name again?
Suckin' away.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
You said -
Who was fixing to betray us!
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
...Yeah?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
You... in the Navy?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
Good morning, girls.
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Why? Because you can do it alone?
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Mayo, are those your friends?
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Pardon?
I called you Sarge.
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
How did it go with you guys?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
You're better than candy.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
What's the matter?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
I'd like to come with you.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
I bet you do!
There is not one thing funny here.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Stop it!  Stop it!
One.  Squeeze.
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
The walls are steel, right?
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
Who is this guy?
Be quiet.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
And we're never getting in.
Can we come in?
May I ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
Huh?
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  Highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
How many more do we have after this?
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
Ever read any Poe?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
That room!
It doesn't work?!
What do they want?
Yeah.
Oh, please.
Morse code?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.
Stop it.
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Where is the Glucogen?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
Hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like Grandma. You're not gonna have an attack. Okay?
What are you doing with the gun?
Well... is it loaded?
Well if anyone's gonna protect Malcolm's legacy it better be us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
So... we understand each other Judge?
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Man, did you see Huey down on Grove street? All up on that cop, that was beautiful.
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Can you make a deal with them?
Now hold on Rodgers...
To be quite honest it turns my stomach.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
So what's the deal?
Judge... we're doing security for Betty Shabazz's visit next week. I'd like to have someone who knows there way around a pistol there. Someone like you.
Yeah.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Sorry man...
We'll all get out of here together.
Why didn't you tell me?
Rose?
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
You call that a compliment?
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Shall we proceed?
That one is a bit more difficult.
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
And the Governor?
Do you intend to enlist without my permission?
Have you seen any Redcoats?
Oh?
How old are you?
You know how old I am.
Flanking riders?
Gabriel?  Are you asleep?
When was that?  In the swamp at the expense of your men?  Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of your family?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
It's beautiful there.  Your mother and I were there once, before you were born.
That's why it was four years between you and Thomas.  It took me that long to regain her respect.
I stand corrected.
One of yours?
I'm sorry I wasn't here for this.
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Fall, six months at the earliest.
That will be all, Major.  I'll wait for Lord Cornwallis.
Thank you.
But father, they might come this way.
Father, you can't let them take him...
Well...I guess not.
Ellie...God doesn't do things like that. I know you loved y'brother, but--
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
I don't get it.
Do you swear?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind. As you may have noticed.
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
No, you shouldn't have stopped. But you got away with it. Important thing is are you sure you're all right?
Whose burying ground?
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
Yes.
A man doesn't always know why he does things, Louis. I think I did it because your daughter ain't ready for her favorite pet to die.
Jud, I buried my son today and I'm very tired. I wonder if we could just--
Because something called a wendigo soured the ground.
I want to wake up. I want to wake up, that's all. I--
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
Getting there.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
Safe!  At Port Royal.  With the Royal Navy.
That boat is my livelihood!
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
Aye, aye, sir!
Elizabeth goes free!
You must swear by the Holy Bible.
No!  You gave your word!
Now, Jack.  That reef is less than a league distant.  It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
No, no, nothing like that.  Very well.  You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
Do you not know what this is, then?
I can't breathe.
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Elizabeth, I'm relieved you're safe.  Clap him in irons.  And behind his back this time.
Although ... I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today.
Difficult ... to say.
Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate --
What?
I'm glad we got here in time.
That was before I met one, of course.
Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ...
When I get the Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach it to the whole crew, and we'll sing it all the time!
Nor did you, I noticed.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
I swear, you look just like him.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
What's that?
Depends.
On what?
I think he's telling the truth.
What happened here?
Not anymore, Mr. O'Brien.  The nanobot has changed that.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
Can you feel it, Poppy?  The presence of the moment?  Can you feel the weight of its significance?
If you loved me like I loved you?
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What are you going to do?
You were never invited to my house.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
You want to tell me what I'm looking for?
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
They did it to me!
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Is something wrong?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
What's that supposed to mean?
Just giving credit where credit is due.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
What's wrong?
That's going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
You didn't think I could just leave you?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Oh shit, the meltdown.  It's spread to the tower.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Only this ain't no tranquilizer gun. Now let's go!
You were looking for us?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
Just listen to this—  Adorable Babykins— Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely—!
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Do you like them?
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
You're acting like a child.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless you' in the crowd?
Huh?
Yeah?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
A what?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
He's probably very tired. You see, he's had to meet all these people personally tonight.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
There you are—!
Okay.
To Old Madrid.
Yeah?
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
She did—?
Pardon me, madam. They phoned through from the Mayor's committee to remind you it's past the hour for the reception.
Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only ten thousand—and you didn't even get those letters from that Jezebel!
With pleasure, Madame!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
A bird in a gilded cage?
Have you got any make up?
Does it look okay?
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
Thanks ... I love you.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Okay--now you listen to me ...  You're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
So.
I don't believe it.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Okay, that's IT!!!
Did you do this?
I think I've got something to say.
It's like the basketball team.
The basketball team?
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Well, I never had to do it before.
And where's that?
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
I don't believe this.
We're supposed to be in school.
You know him?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Does he--you know--like "me"?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
They're happy like this.
No. She really liked you.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah.
What department store did they go to?
Don't get upset.
... Hi.
Bud--I thought you wanted to come home.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
OW!
Why don't you just take me back without it?
Yeah ...
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
What happened?
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
...please, I just don't want it....
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I have work, I can't leave.
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
Are you gonna do it?
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
What?
Goodbye.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Nothing.
I'm just laying on my bed.
I'm in my bedroom.
No.
No.
Really?
You have a girlfriend?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
You lied to me?
I didn't lie.
Hello?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Really?
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
No I didn't say that.
What did he want?
I have a better idea of where we can go.
What?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
What do you mean?
Yeah.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
On my knife.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I know.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Hello, how are you?
......and this is confidential?
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
Who is this?
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
...no....I don't....I don't remember you. Who's this?
Fine, thank you.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
You ok?
What is this?
Yeah.
Where you been?
Yes.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
Well....what do you want, then?
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I know.
You can't just stay in your house.
I'll see you there.
Uch. Shut up, Dean.
We should be going --
So...did my brother call you?
No.
I'm sorry. You're right.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
By whom? The Marquis?
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
Coulmier, you animal!
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
An innocent child is dead.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
AND DID YOU?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
And --?
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
He'll do no such thing.
How is the patient faring?
Poorly.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Most assuredly.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
It's a long story, this one.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
You've come to lecture me?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
Doesn't that please you?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
Oh, but haven't you heard? I'm the Boy Wonder. I've been a genius since the moment I was born.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Sure you can, just--
Sure
Uh-hub.
Why is that, Louis?
There's nothing to explain
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
I wanted it
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
The jigsaw puzzles and the, urn, career -- the man spending a fortune to make her a star -- only it's opera and not movies. And...
Yes?
Sir, I-
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
What are movies about?
Showing life
I don't wanna write about no spic.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Yes.
Please don't say this.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
Now remember he's a public figure who sought out that publicity so legally he can't stop us from--
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
Jesus Christ --
Who owns this town? Who runs every goddamn studio? The tribe, baby. These fuckers hear the word "Jew" and they start sweating. Like Ester Williams' pool they start sweating.
What does this have to do with--?
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Hell, I know how it ends.  Hey, Rosebud's the sled!
Monstro! Ran into Walter Winchell outside He wants to play Herod in the picture. Hiya, George.
To do what?
That's for me to decide.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
It's just that my movie is so-
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Take apart the fucking camera rig -- we could get a few more inches down and then tilt up--
We done?
Yes!
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
Yeah, they're good. They're good, Tommy.
I want to believe you, LaMotta.
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
J.R., glad you could make it.
You're a good sport, lady.
You know?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
How do you know? You know her that good?
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
You know, like bang her or anything?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Sure, I'll keep an eye on her.
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
What?
Whatsa matter with you?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
Does that mean...
Three more, I figure.
You wanted to say hello, eh? I can't believe it. When did you fall outa heaven? Anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. You got a baby face. Look at mine. Whatcha wanna meet me for?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You're not interested in him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Yeah.
Nobody. I love you, remember?
That he's got a pretty face.
I went to the movies.
Jake, no --
Sure, what else is new?
Aw, c'mon. Don't say that.
The kids are sleeping.
But they don't have a case against you.
Don't make no difference no more.
C'mon, Tommy --
Never felt better.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Indo-China -- Jeff predicted it would go sky-high.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there --  -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
You think I made all this up?
If possible -- both.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
Your Lisa?
Read some good books.
Jeff --
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
You're never going to marry?
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
A Federal offense.
You called the police?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
Hello.
You haven't even heard from him?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
How's your leg?
Big enough?
That's good news.
For what?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
That's what the witnesses told him.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
Huh?
I'll rephrase the question.
Is he cleaning house?
Wasn't that close?
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Your name?
Steady Marlon!
A new disease.
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Yes.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
Blood.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
Go ahead.
You're absolutely right!
He depended on me.
You don't?
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
I was talking to Jim.
He's home.  I heard the car.
See?  It stopped.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mrs. Crawford don't believe in them!
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
What?
What's your name!
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.
Judy.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
What?
We'll take it!
Isn't he schizoid?
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
My gun?
Who's that?
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
How!
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Leave me alone.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
What?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Why?
Sure.  Lots of times.
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
You can't talk underwater!
What?
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
Is this him!?
IS THIS NICK MASON!!??
You can't find... what?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.
Yes it was all you --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I'm not him. I...  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
Nick, I love you --
You told him about Nick's letters.
Gabriel!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
Nick, what happened --
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
You what...
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
What'd they call her in college?
Be more specific.
I said, who the hell made the map?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not.
At least gimme video poker.
NO.
No, you're not.
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
Where is he?! Where is he?!
You want that for here or to go?
Monsters in the gelatin...
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Why you gotta. We were gonna give you a ride someplace, man. Now I just don't know.
For twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
What, working security?
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
How'd you know I'd do it.
Map is kinda dirty, Monster...
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
Who?
Elois?
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
It's not the black Beverly Hills, it's the black Palos Verdes. Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a man-eater- upper. I bet every guy who's ever met her has jacked off to her at least once. You know who she looked like? Christie Love. 'Member that TV show "Get Christie Love"? She was a black female cop. She always used to say "You're under arrest, sugar."
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
The Brewers.
What's this?
I just wanted you to know, they meant a lot.
Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
Give me this fucking thing.
Five-man job. Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Larry, I'm askin' you to trust me on this.
You do?
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Hey, just cancel that shit right now! You're hurt. You're hurt really fucking bad, but you ain't dying.
You're not gonna fucking die, all right?
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
You really think we were set up?
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
I'm cool.
That's not correct.
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
Me and Mr. Orange jumped in the car and Mr. Brown floored it. After that, I don't know what went down.
What do I think? I think the cops caught them, or killed 'em.
I got 'em, all right?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
I don't buy it. Me and Joe go back a long time. I can tell ya straight up, Joe definitely didn't have anything to do with this bullshit.
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
...Hey, I know what I'm talkin' about, black women ain't the same as white women.
Not these guys.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
And this is Helen Carter.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
What's the matter with her?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
You're not going out to look for them?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
Maybe it's better that way.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Where you going?
I can't --
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us.  Think he will?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Can I have my gun back?
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Kind of sore.
All right, you didn't know.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
It isn't that --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You got no business snoopin' around --
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
There you are. Now take it easy and you'll be all right.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
And we're running out of that.
How do you know who we are?
Everybody knows --
You're so nice.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Oh, sure.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
Brenda was right. There's more to the story than the Professor told us. I found a secret room. It had all these news clippings about Hugh Kane. He was a very evil man.
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Thanks.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Oh my God! We're dead!
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Let's get outta here.
Yes...
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.
Feel that?
Then what are we going to do?
I don't care. You pick.
Are you okay?
It's the sequel.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Father!
Left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
I'm telling you, it was possessed.
What are you getting at, Professor?
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
What?
You do.
Yours, or the turkeys?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
I'm so glad you're here.
Yo son, check this out.
Get out?! What does it say?
BLOOD FEAST!
Bye, Mrs, Sutphin.
Mrs. Sutphin?
You don't think...
 I can't believe Mr. Stubbins is dead.
Sorry, ma'am.
Cute is not enough, Misty. You know that.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
That's nice.
Shhhh..
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
You bitch!
Mrs. Wilson from the telephone company. I understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
I certainly was not!
Who wants fruit salad?
He killed people, Mom.
Yummy. Carl says if I lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the University of Maryland Fall Mixer.
It's him!
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Carl Padgett died for the Franklin Mint, didn't he?!
That was your People magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
What is it, Mr. Stubbins?
Certainly not!
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
Young man, this Faberge Egg is chipped.
Where?
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
Yes, I understand.
No.
Are you Dr. Louis Judd?
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
Why, Mary --
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
Weren't you afraid?
However, I won't say that I'll not take charge occasionally, and I'm going to take charge new. I've a job for you.
Please —- I can't explain things like this to your right ear.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
And you knew he'd be here.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I don't think that's so revealing.
But it's a small room, Jason.
I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me —-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have everything —— and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
What a peculiar question.
See that girl? That's Jacqueline's sister. It's because of her I ask.
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
Following me to find Jacqueline?
It's my cloven hoof. It trips me up sometimes.
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice —— that's it, isn't it?
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Mary, I'm amazed. Didn't Jacqueline tell you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It's my business now.
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
Why
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
No, not really.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
What are these?
What kind of personal project?
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
To you?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Why not?
Don't you want to make one?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
I've told you.
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
Not entirely.
Yes.
I can't tell you like this.
Yes. I just got busy.
Are you having an affair?
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
What?
I want out of this marriage.
Goddam right.
You son of a bitch!!
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
What do you mean?
Yeah, so?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Perhaps he senses your hesitance at being touched.
What visitor?
Let me rephrase. Were you attracted to him?
What do you mean? I don't understand.
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
He just asked me questions.
I wanted him to see me.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
You are in serious trouble.
Thank you.
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
I don't understand. Why did you want to come here? I mean, I can't imagine Ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.
Whichever you prefer.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
How unfortunate. So when did you finally get to see a penis?
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
What did he say?
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
John Millaney.
Cynthia. John.
What's so stupid about it?
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
You told Ann about this?
I wish you hadn't done that.
No.
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
It'll just be me.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
John Millaney.
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Millaney?
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
Medical clinic?
Another kiss?
Anything wrong?
Where is he now? Do you know?
Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Did I say anything?
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
No it wasn't Janet -- exactly -- It was, in fact, your new sponsor.
McKinley?...McKinley?
Conspiracy?  That sounds a little farfetched.
I'll leave you young things to it.
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
I NEED IT NOW I NEED SOME
Brad has deep feelings of hostility towards you.
If only Brad could have found it within his heart to say these things to me.
Our field.
That's an extremely negative response.
So all in all it's going to be an exciting new series for us...
I don't know. You just seem really familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy your meals.
How's the trip?
Bottle.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Highliner, please.
No, we're paying for the wine.
You said you had it all lined up.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Oh, that's tasty.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
And?
Oh yeah. Much better.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
I'd rather have a knife.
You still seeing that shrink?
And Lexapro, yes.
Huh.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Whoa.
So you're going to stop acting?
Then it's a good thing.
Nice, huh?
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
With Maya?
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Nope.
Is what the money thing?
I said okay?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
You know what I'm thinking?
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Why don't you come in?
Nice. Very nice.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Yeah, I know.
What was the bottle that did it?
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
What's the title?
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
Sure.
Bathroom over there?
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!
That was fun last night.
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
It makes me feel better.
A hair.
My ballet recital.
I've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. Can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. No one's got hurt mind you... And that's the give away.
I cursed.
Yes.
They caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
What are you doing?
Have they said anything about our area?
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
Is that him?
It's like War of the Worlds.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
You brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if I mind. Mister, I don't know any of those names and you're about to die.
I'd be worse if you hadn't come along.
I already did that.
My name is Emmett.
Jefferson City?
You know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Where is Rae?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
What about the law?
That's a lie.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
Believe it.
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
Who is he?
What's the matter, Paden? You afraid I couldn't get those two behind me?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
The jury saw it differently.
It's none of your business.
Why him?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
It's been a while.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
And I know what I'm talking about.
Who's the owner?
You really are a gambler.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I wouldn't worry about that.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
The picture's dead.
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Even the fall from the plane.
As I've tried to explain to you, Elaine.  Simone isn't like any other actress you've ever known. She's about the work and only the work -- lives for the work.  She wants all the money up there...  ... on the screen where it belongs. She'd work for scale except I know you only respect people you pay a fortune.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
Soon.  Soon.
Yes, you do...  Anyway, tonight was a good start.
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
Not if I don't let her.
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
You're with me to be close to her?
You don't secretly want the attention?
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
You want me to call Security?
I was misquoted.
It's me, Mr. Taransky.  Don't you recognize me? -- The Future of Film conference in San Jose. Hank... Hank Aleno.  I was keynote speaker.  You must remember my speech... "Who Needs Humans?"
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
Listen, Hank, it's been a rough day.  I'll call you about his next week.
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Can't you stop that?
Why?
I know plenty of boys.
I do.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
I love you, Lainey.
I know.  Thank her for me.
-- I bet you have.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Of course -- no one's that perfect, that pure.  You know I had something on Mother Teresa.  But then she died and it wasn't worth it anymore.  I know how to flush out this Simone -- a tell-all story from her childhood.
What if it catches on fire?
Hi.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
Good morning, Simone.
I am the death of real.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
--My God.
Dr. Crowe.
No.
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
You want to ask me a question?
Private Kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
What'd you write?
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
You can see her?
Where is she?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
She wanted me to tell you--
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
S-ssssstop it!
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Suzie???
Come on --
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Curt Cobain.
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
How... was she "called?"
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
People say he was a murderer.
I'm admiring your costume. What "movie" are you going as again?
You know what they say about men who need big guns...
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Chicken sandwich?
Shit!
What about Jeremiah?
I'm talking to the spirit of Jethro Macdonald. Is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? We'll be careful of the bed --
You wouldn't understand.
Yeah. Great work, Rod. But next time, it would be nice... if you could JOIN US FOR THE ENTIRE SET!
Comes with some Goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
There's a place over there on the bluffs. When the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of Main look like a kaleidoscope.
When you wanted to run away, I called your dad.
We'll just head up here into Bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. Then maybe we'll head off to Hollywood after all, huh?
It's my nature.
And then we get here, the Castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
Where are you?!
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Are you nodding?
Shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. Come pick us up.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Okay.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Shoot.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
The bus'll pick you up over there.  Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Jesus!!!
I would've come back for you.
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
My very words.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Absolutely.
Why should I?
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?
Or in the slammer.
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
What are you doin' now?
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Yeah?
Liquid gold.
Yeah, guy?
I'm at marker eight-five.
I ran into complications.
Never mind. It's nothing.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
I'm here.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
It ain't ever been done before, hot shit.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
Yes, ma'am.
That's the point, Dickey.
-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
Of course. Yes.
I tell you, engineering this kind of play against Sparazza, going to the lengths these guys are going to... they're playing some long odds.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
He's giving them up?
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Two of 'em?
I've got concerns.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
Your attitude sucks.
D'you talk to'm?
Are you a fucking colossal idiot?
Answer your fucking pages! I've been calling for fifteen minutes, we need you up here to clean NOW!
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
-- will be handled back in --
...Does he know?
...When did you know all this?
You're trying to save Sparazza?
You got clicks, anything?
-- he's doing it then, huh --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
I DON'T KNOW!
What's the time frame?
What happened to Gibarian?
You murdered her!
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
Human beings can die.
What happened?
I love her.
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
Rheya...
And tonight?
Rheya.  Not here.
You go home.
Is it a planet?
I like that too.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Do I really feel like... I am...?
You... she said I didn't love her.
You said he was dead.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
Can we go then?
Claire?
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
How did you know?
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
What's to like?
I can't open it.
You put me life in danger.
Yeah.
I don't know you...
"For"...?
I like your coat.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Claire...
Nothing.
My ass is falling.  It is.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Hey.  The neighbors.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Why?
Coming to bed?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
What're you talking about --
What did you watch?
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
They're operating on him.  He's still alive.
I heard a lot... Anything you want to deny, Mike?
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
... Hard?
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
Hold it...!
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
Lay back, Mack.
You coming in?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
Shooting.
Shooting?
And Flash isn't?
Here you go, Pete.
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Don't be pitiful.
And you let me go on about Rosomoff working me too hard?  I feel like a complete idiot.
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
Bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  Did you get pictures?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
He'll weasel out of trouble. Again.
My my.
What are you doing this weekend?
So you've found Thorkel?
When I moved out, you swore up and down you wouldn't meddle--
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
Absolutely no class.
Oh, Ben gets through everything.
Poison emergency.
Is this some sort of Zen thing?
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
My God, Otto, you have to hear me! The world we know will collapse! Everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
Mr. Reiss-- I need a quarter--
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Is you all good Nazis?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
A lot sharper, Sefton! I'd like to have some of that loot you got in those footlockers!
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
Put me down for ten, you louse.
Then we're all in on it?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
I'm okay here. Why bother?
You have no idea how boring my life here is. If it weren't for an occasional air raid or some foolish prisoners trying to escape, I wouldn't know what to do. I want to thank you for keeping me company. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't read. I hate music. That only leaves good conversation. It will be a shame to lose you.
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl?
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Schnickelfritz! I told you Schnickelfritz! Why'd you make me bet on Equipoise!
So what? There's other women!
It's that song, Harry!
Don't worry. We'll take care of it.
Not yet.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Go on.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
What did you say?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
This is me in Cincinnati.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
My grandmother's ear-muffs.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
Have a nice time over there?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Data, are you all right?
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
That's where he's going.
Commander.
I don't see a control panel, or an access port.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Guinan, what's going on? Where am I?
These are my children...my children.
I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard.
What about the gravimetric distortions? They'll tear us apart.
That's right.
You could say that.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
A remarkable piece of equipment, but a little inelegant, wouldn't you say?  Have you ever considered a prosthesis that would make you look a little more...normal?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Don't you think you're taking this a little too far, Number One?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Captain, are you all right?
The thought had crossed my mind.
We're all mortal, Soran. It's one of the truths of ou existence.
As their cloak begins to engage, their shields will drop.
Worf, prepare a spread of photon torpedoes. We'll have to hit them the instant they begin to cloak.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
... Fascinating.
Check for trace radiation. Infrared enhancement.
Well. There's your life form reading. These were microbes on the tube's surface. We shot them here from Enterprise.  They were fruitful, and multiplied.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
It was the only way to solve certain problems --
This planet is aging in surges.
I don't understand.
Grissom to landing party. We have you approaching radioactive indications. Do you concur?
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
Saavik... Does Dr. Marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
I'm almost done, sir. You'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
Mr. Scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. Sight on the center of the mass.
On course, Admiral. Estimating Spacedock in two point one hours.
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
Mr. Sulu, what is the crew complement of a Bird of Prey?
About a dozen officers and men.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --

If we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
"Met his death"?  How could you, his friend, have assumed that? Why did you leave him on Genesis! Spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Then, how --
... He spoke of your friendship.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Yes... But -- how...?
Range: 3000 Kellicams.
Good for you, Lieutenant.
I am going to do nothing about it. <u>You</u> are going to sit in the closet.
I'm almost afraid to. What did you bring me, contraband Klingon --
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Jim --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
This? It took the Starfleet corps of engineers ten months in space suits to tunnel out all this. What we did in there -- we did in a day. David, why don't you show Dr. McCoy and the Lieutenant our idea of food.
David. Please.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
Let go -- he can't -- !
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
No!
Genesis, what's that?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
We'll be going to warp speed --
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Your first training voyage, Mr. Preston?
The word is given: warp speed.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Admiral, you can't give him Genesis...
The prefix code?
Aye sir --
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Very well.
Lieutenant, are you wearing your hair differently?
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
I can't get power, sir!
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
I mean <u>him</u>, back at his post, like nothing happened. I don't know if you'd got the whole picture but he isn't exactly working on all thrusters.
Bones, stay here.
I prefer a dose of common sense. you are proposing to head backwards in time, find Humpback Whales, then bring them forward in time, drop them off - and hope they tell this Probe what to do with itself!
That's crazy!
Wake up, man, wake up!
I did not have time on Vulcan to review the Philosophical disciplines.
Really? You think this is its way of saying "Hi there" to the people of the Earth?
You're saying... It is a compliment.
Fundoscopic examination --
My name is Pavel Chekov. I am a Lt. Commander in Starfleet, United Federation of Planets, service number 656-5827b.
All right. Let's take it from the top.
I do not know your name.
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Status report, Admiral!
You sure you won't change your mind?
Came all the way down here to jump in and swim with the kiddies, huh?
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Where could you take them?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Wanna try it from the top?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
All right. The truth?
You want the details?
Then tell me when the whales are leaving.
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
... Gone?!
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Permission granted.
The late 20th Century.
What are the variables...?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
About those colorful metaphors we discussed. I don't think you should try to use them.
I see.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
Admiral. Full power is restored.
Warp two... three...
Three-one-zero, aye!
Sir -- I've got some back pressure on manual --
Systems report.  Communications?
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
Humpbacked - people.?
How long, Scotty?
Admiral! There be whales here!
Stand by, sir. Miracle worker at work...
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
Professor Scott, if you'll --
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Chotto omachi nasarei. Namae wa nanto moosareruka na.  Wait my son. What is your name?
I understand how you feel. We just want to retrace Data's movements that day...
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Why not...?
Can he breathe under water?
How many?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
We're taking this ship out of here... this mission is over...
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
A planet in Federation space...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
That's your expert opinion?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
I thought subspace weapons were banned by the Khitomer Accord...
We're still thirty-six minutes from transmission range, sir.
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
Sensors are not picking up any ships coming from the surface...
He might be using the planet's rings to mask his approach.
Direct hit. He's resetting his shield harmonics...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Good hunting. Hayes out.
Montana.  Energize.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
That is not true. They have tried to help me.
I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated.
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
But now... they are all one with the Borg.
Data... are you sure you're all right?
Alphanumeric lock. We need a password to get in...
Ready to make a little history?
Captain... we've got less than ten minutes before that Vulcan ship leaves the system. We've got to go <U>now</U>.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Captain, the Enterprise!
Yes.
Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there.
The invasion plans.
What makes you say that?
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Track their weapons fire.
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Report.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
I didn't mean this future.
We're explorers not diplomats!
Are you carrying a surgeon?
You were demoted...
Get close enough to a man and you can kill him on "Stun" without setting off the alarm - of course you can't get rid of the body...
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
And your coat.
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
Uhura, hailing frequencies. Right standard rudder, bring us alongside...
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
WE volunteered?
Spock, I'm really tired...
The Klingons have a new weapon: a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked. She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
I've been dead before. Uhura, raise Excelsior. She ought to have the co-ordinates.
What's she waiting for?
Captain, we can't see her, but she gives off heat...
Faith...?
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
A lie?
Direct hit -
Trouble?
It's as I said, Mr. Spock: Inventory still registers every torpedo.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible whatever remains - however improbable - must be the truth.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Fuzzy face is gone.
Because you are dangerous.
I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along with the rest of you. As most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise, to assume command of Starfleet Medical. Again, I'm forced to ask, Beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole’ me?! I'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I don’t show up for my physical on time!
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
He was a damn fool. Selfish and ambitious. Very much in need of seasoning.
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
If I were... I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior. I would "miss you."
He is very observant.
Data!
"For now we see but through a glass darkly..." He said he's a mirror.
Yes.
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
He may have already rejected my humanity, but you also have a twin
What purpose does this serve?
Don't give up hope, Data. I know, I know, you're not capable of hope.
It's you.
May I have this dance?
I would say he's been trained to resist telepathy. What I could sense of his emotions were erratic, very hard to follow.
Captain -- I might have a way to find them.
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Just lucky, Admiral.
I'm picking up an unusual electromagnetic signature from the Kolarin system.
What's this?
We have to assume he had Romulan collaborators.
Why don't they answer our hails?
His hatred of the Federation is apparent. He would have built a weapon of that scope for one reason. He is going after Earth.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
And the Senate supports you?
Right now, you’re thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
We need to talk, just you and I.
What happened?
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
What about Picard?
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
It's accelerating. You have no more time for games.
Join us, Commanders.  Now what's the disposition of the fleet?
They're holding position.
The Enterprise is immaterial! They won't make it back to Federation space.

I don't see anything.
There is. They came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
Don't you think you should call a backup?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
No!!! No!!!
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
It's taken on a disguise.
Clarify that.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
What's all this for?
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
Eh... police.
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Pancakes.
What?
No gas.
Space?
No gas.
When do you have to be here?
I need you.
The driver will...
You want this ticket?
Yes.
Go?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
Do you have music up there?
I am not a good singer.
You can have one.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I will go. But not you.
Where are you going?
I must meet my ship.
I feel better if I move.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
If you want to keep it, you can.
How long will it take you to get home?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
What do I do now?
Oh God, man... don't shoot me... My mistake... I'm sorry...
The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
Doesn't make sense.
You get that, Lyman?
Very beautiful country up here...
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Bullshit politics.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head.  You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
That's a good one, coming from you.
He has his uses too.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
Faith, we know about Jeriko.  Iris made me a copy of the tape.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
No.
That's right.  Clips.  Look, I want you to know what we're talking about here.  This isn't like TV only better.  This is life.  It's a piece of somebody's life.  Pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex.  You're there. You're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.
Listen, before we get into numbers, I want you to try a taste.  I got a deck with me.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
D'you always have to dress like a fuckin' pimp?
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Yeah.  She's leaving with Tran so I got to boogie.  Real quick... Iris checked into the Sheraton last night under a false name.  Paid cash.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
What clip?  What was it?
Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist.
Excuse me.  What part of NO don't you understand?
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
So, what's up with you?  Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Fumitsu.
Are we having a bad night?
That would be no.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
And gives it to you.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
The question is not whether I am paranoid, but whether I am paranoid enough.  You want to rub my neck?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
I see.  I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
I'm not going.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
No.  I haven't noticed because I make my payments.  So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Who knows.
This isn't in our database?
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
You heard?
You... surprised me.
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
How did you know he was a construction worker?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
Maybe cause he's smart.
Sorry to interrupt you, sir, but I thought you'd like to know.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
I think I talked to him.
They don't know how to crack these secret chat rooms --
Let some by-the-book J. Edgar Agents go into the chat room, spook these guys with stupid questions, blow my cover? -- no way.
How do you feel, Agent
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
I'm hesitant to...
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
Miss me, Dave?
When I was at the rest stop, there was a young boy, maybe ten, and his mother. Darryl Hawkins, Zero, abducted the boy in the men's room. I tried to stop him. He cold-cocked me --
Doesn't fit.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
It's a no-no.
I know.
What did you tell him?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
What's up?
My watch. He toyed with me. He sent me to Chicago.
Suspect Zero.
Kulok.
Agent Mackelway?
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
I don't carry it with me.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
There's someone out there, Mack, I know, some man killing for the fun of it, sniffing human glue, without regard to age or sex, without predicable M.O. Someone who has a way to dispose of the bodies. You have access, you can call up local authorities, check morgues, conduct interviews. Be my man.
You did. You were with her when she disappeared, right? She took you to the mall or the movies, you turn around and she's gone.
It was the mall.
Maybe you should back off.
[Reality very risky.]
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
Well, thank you...?
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Like the quiche?
You too?
Uh, if the guy wants to.
You want to come with us to a party at the Chateau Marmont? They got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
...then ask where you met her...
Oh, I'm sorry. How'd your folks take it?
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
Let me just check on my boy.
...And she's with someone else.
Do you ever perform out here? I'd love to see you.
I'll be around.
...It's really getting late.
How are you doing?
Good.  I think about things.
Why didn't you call?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
Kinda money, huh?
Him?
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
You should play another team. The Kings are bitches in this game.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
...How can you compare them? Tarantino totally bites everything from Scorsese...
Thanks, man.  I've been hating myself for the last two days.
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
VEGAS.
When?
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Vegas.
She smiled baby.
We're gonna get laid, baby.
I know, but...
You gotta do it.
Always.
Thanks for clarifying that.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Baby, don't talk like that, baby.
What an asshole.
Did she, or did she not smile.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
Christy was nice...
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
What?!?
Yeah. You met him once.
Which one?
What are you doing?
How long do I wait to call?
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
Bitch... You little bitch!
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
You think?
...double diamond...
...we're not...
...Tomorrow, then a day.
...Shut up, Sue...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
It's on.
Sorry man.
Anything...Anything the Godfather wishes.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
Bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help.  I don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.
What do you wish me to do?
Eat it, it's on the table.
Yeah.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
How bad will it be?
Are you worried about security for your million?
Is it necessary?
I'm sure it's the most generous gift today.
And with prison record.
Should I bring him in.
I didn't tell Mama anything.  I was about to come up and wake you and tell you.  Just now.
For killing a man.
You wanted me to be your son.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
That is your birthright...but Michael, use this car.
How do you know I come from America?
Get the car.  I'll be leaving in ten minutes.  Where's Calo?
Ever seen anything like that before?
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Mike, why am I out?
How will they come at you?
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
No.
He'll be OK.
Please say it.
I'm busy.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Sollozzo is a dead man, I don't care what it costs.  I don't care if we have to fight all the five families in New York.  The Tattaglia family's going to eat dirt.  I don't care if we all go down together.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
All right, Sonny.  All right.
To the city.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
I'm glad you came, Mike.  I hope we can straighten everything out.  All this is terrible, it's not the way I wanted things to happen at all. It should never have happened.
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting. Says we can straighten any of our problems out.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
Sure. Any time.
Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine.
I just woke up. I'm sorry.
Is that good?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Okay, we're going to Naples. There's a club, it's not a club, it's a cellar.
It's vile.
No, I like him.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
Forging signatures. Telling lies. Impersonating practically anybody.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
I'm never going back!
Your parents met her.
I played piano in a few places.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
No!
What does he say?
Relax.
Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is -- if you want to be a tourist -- grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station.
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
Why?
Ha.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
Marge and I are getting married.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Yes, I'm good, thank you. Dickies at dinner. He's at Otello's. Do you know it?
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Of course, he's been very involved in his music, hasn't he? I think his theory is, you know, you have to go into a cocoon before you can become a butterfly.
Hardly.
Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Pleasure to meet you, Dickie's made a fine catch. I know Emily thinks so.
Are you okay?
What about Cortina?
Ha. Did he say why?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
You've got Dickie's rings.
Today, for the first time, I've even wondered whether he might have killed Freddie. He would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him -- well, you know that. Marge. I loved you -- you might as well know -- I loved you, and because he knew I loved you, he let you think I loved him. Didn't you see, couldn't you see? I don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. Tom loves me.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I hope so.
Is this you?
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Excuse me?
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
Randall.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Is Freddie in Rome?
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Dickie, my God!
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me.
So -- are you travelling under R?
I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Tom, are you okay?
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back.  You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
I really don't want to see anybody.
You have, yes.
If you don't mind, mam, I'd rather work for you.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Really?
Huh?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
The singer?
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Hello, Travis.
Oh, Tom, please.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This is gotta be a game, right?
You sure he's not Italian?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
That's fine.
You said that?
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
One-Ball McCall?
Where.
You carry a piece? You need one?
You looking for some action?
That ain't much of a name.
What's your real name?
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do you understand why I came here?
Well, I tried.
Well, you want to or not?
Where?
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
You a narc?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Physical? Criminal?
Sure.
Your name Sport?
I'm here to see Iris.
Well, I just, you know...
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
Could we change the subject?
Maybe.  Not really.
Well yes I suppose ...
I'll go.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
You'll stand by me?
Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
You look... different.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
My what?
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Yes, sir.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
Mother o'god...
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
That's Lily.  Your mother, rest her soul.
"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Forty-two was a lean year around here.  The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall.  Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me.  At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
Dad, I...
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
What.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
I don't remember.  I guess so. Smells like it.  Tastes like it.
That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does.
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
You should watch what you say.
You can't testify.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
When was that?
No, I...
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
They all know you?
Mr. Appleton, I have reason to believe you're holding something back, and that just rubs me the wrong way.  Sir, are you a communist?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
Yes.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I despise it.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
She already has a daughter.
And the second?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
They haven't harmed anyone.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
The little Brenner girl.
What name?
I wonder if you could tell me...
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name, you see.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
How much for the phone calls?
I didn't even know there were many crows in Bodega Bay this time of year.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
And certainly pretty.
Yes, Mother.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
I got them all, Mother.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Where will we go?
They're gone. The same pattern.
We won't be here.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
I started to say... inside...
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Would you like me to go for her?
Does this room look silly?
Well, if there's anything else I can do, Mitch...
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I understand completely, sir.
What are you? A policeman?
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
Why... 
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
How do you know Annie?
Can't see a thing.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Famished.
Why did he shoot her?
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Yes.
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Last night? What do you mean?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Of birds?
Well, they'll go along with anything.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
How long have they been gathering there?
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
The power.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
How soon?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
That's right, sir, I recall it. A large flock of seagulls got lost in a fog and headed in for the town, where all the lights were.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
Oh, you'll have ample opportunity -- ample --  Good morning, Dr. Fettes.
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
I can't do that -- you heard MacFarlane.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Where can I find him?
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
I don't know that -- neither do you.  This subject may have been an epileptic -- thrown a fit -- fallen out of bed -- cracked her skull and killed herself -- there is everything explained -- the bruise on her head --
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
I pass up no opportunities, I've a whole course of lectures in mind for you fellows.  We'll need subjects to demonstrate. Come along.
Are you a doctor, too?
Why, yes.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
It might be an interesting case.
You know what you want and don't want -- so that's an end of business between us -- but we'll still be friends, Toddy.  I'll be dropping by to see you and Meg once in a while -- for auld lang syne, you know.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
The heart pumps it.
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
Get out of here!
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
But she must be able to move. Everything is in place.
Aye --
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Was that it? Well, ok.
You think I'm crazy.
The strip joint?
Keep that thing away from me.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
The scar.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
I know her friends.
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
This tree. Here's where it happened.
I wish I could hate him but I can't. He said he'd never hurt either of us, and I know it's true and... I'm going back.
It's ok, it's ok...
Guy dressed for Halloween?
How about sign of a big black bird?
What's with your friend there?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What? What is it?
You should see it, Professor Barnhardt! You should go out and see it for yourself!
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Gee -- those look like diamonds!
Bet they're worth about a million dollars.
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
I will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.  I don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.
I can judge only by what I see.
Never mind about that.  You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
Mr. Carpenter, I--  Goodnight.
I want to know what he told you last night.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
Hello.
I was.
How did you get in here? And what do you want?
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
Would you like to sell it?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
They're gaining on us!
Time to activate Plan B.
Shut up!
Good.
Did you see that sucker burn?!
<u>Four</u> to go.
Death to all vampires!
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
And these Archies should be over here with the Richie Rich's.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
What's that smell!?
You have a T.V.?
Whatcha doin' over here?
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
Still mad at me?
For what.
No.  I'm up.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
Okay?
I'm tired now.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.
You've heard this story before?
You've got a generous nature.  I like that in a person.  My name is Max.
Say hello to Thorn.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
This looks terrific, Lucy.
Well, I...
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
I wouldn't have given my Mom such a hard time about moving here if I'd known I was going to meet you.
Huh?
Where are we going?
Mom's home?...
What about Nonook?  What have you done to Nanook?!  What have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
So what's our problem?
... It could have gotten to somebody...
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
You can't let anybody leave!
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
What?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Happens all the time, man.  They're falling out of the skies like flies. Government knows all about it... Chariots of the Gods, man... They practically own South America.  I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew...
Childs, where's that magneto from Chopper One?
Why didn't it imitate Fuchs?  Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Torch it over there!
But...
What?
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
What are you doing?
When was the last time you used it?
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
Sanchez...?  Hey, who...
How we going to try and find out who's... you know, who's who?
This storm do that?
We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
So what do you make of it?
Now how did you get hurt?
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
... Thousands and thousands of people.  And sometimes we live in great buildings that reach up five or ten stories.
The Hall of Books.
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
But you escaped.
My God... I saw this.
No...
Vox --
I'll never forget this.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Say I just come back again?
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
That was a foolish thing to do.
I'm tired of running.
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
I am the Fifth Avenue Public Library informational kiosk.  VOX registration NY-114.  May I help you?
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
All right, what is it now?
Got here as soon as I could.
Dance with me...
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Now I know you're ill -- passing up the chance to explore some new gadget.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
She made the best Shepherd's pie I ever tasted.
For God's Sake, David --
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
I would.
Why don't you come to our house instead?
All right.  I'll come for dinner. And in the meantime... you'll think about what we discussed?
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Yes.
Every night.
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
You liked it there.
Did you have fires at night?
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
Yes... a little scorching on the upholstery but otherwise all ship- shape.
Oh huzzah, the master's home.
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
Yes, sir.
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
Then don't.
What about Starks?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
And what does that mean?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
Of people like you. People I was just trying to help. They couldn't get worse so I thought, with medication, they might get...
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
Why?
[Beat] What?
But no one knew until after...
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
You're sure?
What? What are you thinking?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
When we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? Do you remember your address?
Good. How's your mom?
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Why, what would you do?
[Beat] I don't know.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
No. Not for people like me. [Beat] Not in the places I come from.
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
Because of the future. I know what's going to happen.
Who...who kills me?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
It's gonna be sticky.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
You like it?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
What.
Have a good day at work today.
What?!
What?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's Thelma Dickinson's husband.
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Hey.
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  We're trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  So far, we got nothin'.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
That's certainly possible.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Hey!  Don't let them shoot those girls.  This is too much.  They got guns pointed at 'em!
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
Tell me.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit Arkansas.
Christ, sure... yes!
Hey, peaches.
Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask you one thing?
Can I just ask you one other thing?
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
In case of what?
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
It means shut up, Thelma.
You're not touchin' that car.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
You're disturbed.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
I... I...
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
Yeah.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Thelma!
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
You do?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
He said they're charging us with murder.
No.
Good.
We can change our names.
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
Louise!
Where?!
God!  It looks like the Army!
I'm not apologizing for shit!
Where you goin'?
What?
You sent that?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Well then you've got to call her, man.
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Got cash.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
Dom? What are you?
Out getting coffee.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
Thanks.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
What's that?
I beg your pardon?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
You're a movie buff?
Have you seen it?
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Uh-huh.
I don't buy it.
No.
Four kids, three different guys.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out.  The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Turn her over to a stalker.
Oh Christ... poor dog.
Your turn?
You what?
And you met Mary how?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Magda!
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
Hey.
Yeah?
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
You got what stuck?
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?
Franks and beans!
Yes, Captain, you may proceed. Clear your guns.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
He gets it, but he's pissed.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Smoke.
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
What's it about?
That is correct.
An invasion...
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
When are you going to be home?
-- we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal. He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President. I think we've won.
Three weeks before midterm elections? You need me.
Dean Rusk!
Still think Cuba isn't important?
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
South Dakota...  Did I do something unsatisfactory, Sir?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.
Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.
Go ahead.
Her oil pan is shot.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Alright. Alright...
She's that subtle?
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
What are you --
You're trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
He said he doesn't know.
He also said "listen to the water."
Jimmy didn't do it, Ray. I checked it out. You can stop taggin' my sister.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
It's not real.
Jesus Christ. You're hammered. What are you doing?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with me.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Where was this?
You were running with the old ones. At The Knee. Heavy duty.
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
What?
They got us sealed. What are we gonna do?
Who did?
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
X22. Read.
Good.
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Woh, excuse me, Sir... I see what you're saying... I've got a little Indian blood, that's true. But --  I am not an... an Indian. I can't just go in and --
Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. How long you been in it?
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
You ever try solitary confinement?
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
I'll bet!
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I thought he'd never leave.
You saw a MiG 21?
Two.
Two miles.
It never came up.
Um. You.
I can't.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Evan... or Maverick.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
What plane.
You're horrible
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't have to kill it.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
I want it understood.
I'm still second best.
I was flying...my responsibility.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Strip reality! How do you play that?
How does it go?
Who's gonna win?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
How could you?
I live here, remember?
Sir?
Can't shake him.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
I'm pulling up.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
Passing 8. Passing 6. Lock your harness!
280, 290, 300 knots.
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
You hear that? Anything we want. Anything...Well???
Nice. Always a good idea to show up your instructors. He nods toward Jester, glaring at them from his A4. Goose indicates the backseat of the Tomcat.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
It's a victory roll.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
Time to go.
3000 feet. I'll do it.
That's Kazanski.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
We did it.
Figured it out yet?
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Just below ten thousand.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
It was bad.
You didn't help.
For the same reason you are.
No bother.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
So, where to?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
I am Quaid.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Now let's get down to business.  Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.  And he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  Now I have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --Do you think you can play along?
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Oh shit....Oh shit...
Okay, this is what we're gonna do. Renata, cover up any memory he has of us or Rekall.
What do you want?
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
Any news of Quaid?
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Yeah.
Hey Harry...Harry!  You ever heard of Rekall?
Rekall?
Yeah.
Harry!
Are you saying she liked it?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
The fare is eighteen credits, please.
Yeah, sweetheart?
And you believe him?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Oh God, Doug.
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
I guess he didn't.
...What?
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
She wasn't really my wife.
No. Let's forget everything!  I've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
Like what?
The reactor.
The one in the mine!
I can't believe it.  No tracks, no sign, no spoor.
What do you think?  Max firepower or...?
She's got my vote.
I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  Good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Oh, Jesus!!
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  Maybe it's long gone.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
<u>I'm</u> making the run to the Cat.
Light it, man!  LIGHT IT!!
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
We playing cards tonight?
Yeah, Val.
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
Well, what's wrong with it?
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Yeah, geography.
Around here?  Why would they?
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
It worked!  There they go!
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
I have to talk to your brother.
Objection.
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
No. No...
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
That DD-5.
Do you have to do that?
I didn't ask for a closing argument.
But what?
Hey -- you believe what you want. Shu Kai Kim is innocent.
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
I'm not that desperate.
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
...Jesus!
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
I haven't thanked you for your work, Kitty. You're doing good work.
Racist asshole came at me.
I guess he... wanted you to think he was... somebody he wasn't.
But why?
Afraid of what?
How can I tell you what I don't know!
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I did two tours in 'Nam...
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
I think you're a dangerous man, Mr. Dowd.
What were you... Why were you at Shu's trial this afternoon?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
Five years.
Shu's the only one I know of...
And why was an exception made?
The phone company was broken up.
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO DONNA?
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
What was here, Mr. Rodd?
Did she have someone with her?
Yes they do. Did she have visitors?
You weren't kiddin'. This stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
Did you know Teresa Banks?
No.
No.
How come Jack let's you work here?
Came looking for a job with a friend of hers. Pretty girl. Could've been her sister.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
That's what I heard.
What is it?
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
The usual, 9:15.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Call me.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
If I can smoke it.
Where are the Cookies?
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Laura, I am your friend.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
You got it.
Nice night.
No... No...
A little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something I am certainly willing to put up with.
Hey, Jacques...
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
This afternoon?
What about tonight?
What do you mean?
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You're getting warmer.
Yes.
No.
I always thought you knew it was me.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
What are you doing?
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Mr. Abraham...
Four cases in three years...
How did you settle on the amount?
What is the truth?
This is going to drive the ante up.
You've just said you signed it.
Thank you, your Honor. We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code: 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.' And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now: we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
Yes.
I was her doctor.
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
And what did your team do...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
Hold on a second.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
...I made a reservation at...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Dr. Thompson. From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Why is that?
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much...
The most respected...
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
We have to... we... we have to keep you under wraps. Please don't, don't discuss...
I've been meaning to come in a long time.
Mrs. Simmonds.
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
Yes.
What did she say?
One hour.
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
Sustained. Yes. The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Galvin, look, many years ago...
What happened...?
And it's over...?
Who told you that?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
How come you're calling me from...?
You know what happened.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who are you protecting, then?
Yes. Yes, I have.
I have to talk to you.
Are you out of your mind...?
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
You -- Listen: you said to me, 'if not now, when...'
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
What happened, Joey...?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital. She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
You use their witness.
What the hell are you doing here?
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.  The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.  She wanted to move to Boston.  How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Huh. And why is that?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
You look kinda lost yourself.
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
That's right - came down in kinda spurts, didn't it?  You fellers'll have to figure it out.  You're scientists  All I know - they say it's as big as a house and practically red hot.
They are living creatures out there.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
They'll understand us, all right!
He's not showing it until it's down.  But it sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.  You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we needed to know.
So?
Come on.  Kids love horror.
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
What?
I don't follow.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
Like Freddy.
Does he have to stay here over night?
Dylan?  He's holding well.  Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
Mommy's fine, Dylan.  Just had a bad dream.  What're you doing out of bed?
Tell you what.  I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now.  You know home isn't far from here, right?
You okay?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Darker.  More...evil?
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
The car's no there yet?
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
Then, in this nightmare in progress, does this thing have any weaknesses?
It can be captured, sometimes.
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
Can I get you something to drink?
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Guilty.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
What do you mean?
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
What's the difference?
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
How ya doing?
The Dolphin was a symptom.
I mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  What right did then have to show up here?
Does Phil know how you guys feel?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
I can take care of myself.
Why'd you jump?
Don't ever call me stupid.
Why, man?
Well, that was neighborly.
What are you blubbering about?
There are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the Albatross.  I have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
How old are you?
I'm from all over.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
You an indian?
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
You heard from Reggie?
What'd you say?
Mostly black though in that boogie place.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
So, it's back to the islands.
Hasta siempre.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
You ain't actin', mama.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
That so?  You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
What's that, peanut?
Actin' funny how?
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
Sailor!
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
They sure do stink.
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
What's that, peanut?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
Under a hundred.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
How'd you know my daddy?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
I'll bet.
In the Ganges near Varanasi to try and reduce human pollution and now plan to put in the crocodiles to devour floatin' corpses dumped by Hindus too poor to pay for cremation.
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Course I am, mama.
What if I told you not to?
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
You really are one dumb asshole.
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I didn't see nothin'...
He's fine. He's narrating.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Thank you.
Piss off, Crabs. I lost a wife today.
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Gee, I don't know, Crabs. I don't seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
So tell me about you and the Chancellor.
Is he awake?
Shut up, James.
Find the jacket.
Such as.
I have an alternate version of the first chapter.
That was MacCaulay.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
You peeked, didn't you?
Don't sweat it. Well. 'Night, Jeff.
You must be mistaken.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I've been trying to finish a book...
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Hey, Vernon. Can I ask you a question?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Well...
Really?
I'm sorry. Professor Tripp. Maybe it's seeing that jacket that belonged to her. It just looks... really lonely. Hanging there. In a closet. Maybe I'm just a little sad.
Can I ask you something about her?
Oh. So. Is -- is your friend Crabtree -- is he -- gay?
Oh.
That's a big book you're writing.
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
I never heard of it.
James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Want a bite?
It's because you don't eat.
Where you going?
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Right. Anyway, I was wondering if I could borrow your car. Mine's sort of out of commission.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
Emily left me this morning.
She's left before...
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
About the baby.
Someone stole my car.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
And what did you say?
I'm through improvising.
I went and looked at some babies just now.
He's writing his name in water.
It's three-thirty, Grady.
No. I guess you're here for the backpack.
Who's that guy?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
And?
Where's Emily, Hank?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
Foreman now.
Beautiful. How's business?
Law says I can't come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. I figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. Make a bet?
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Cherry.
Notice the grain. See how deep and rich the red runs?
It was a beautiful present.
You need a table.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Maybe I'm not a good man. Maybe inside I'm bad, and I'll always be bad.
I don't like starlings.
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Were you watching me?
I think you do.
I could get a search warrant.
Too much sun.
Woodsman?
The one with the ax?
Little Red Riding Hood.
I was asleep.
You said last night. I went to bed pretty early.
I count my blessings.
But you are taking it?
I'd keep away from him.
Have you seen Walter?
No you're not.
Walter.
Banished... yeah.
Are you sure?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
What will happen if I do?
I know because... it's just something I know.
No.
I don't understand.
Ev-i-dence.
You don't like coming here, do you?
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Do you know what "normal" is?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
I don't know.
Please don't do it again.
How old are you and your sister?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
It was a small house.
She's still really hurt... and angry. I don't know... if she will ever... forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope... I just want her to...
How do you feel about that?
Want a ride?
What picture?
Very weird.
Southern light.
I'll buy a plant.
No you're not.
What's the worst thing you ever did?
What did you do to them?
I never hurt them. Never.
What?
You know, this is crazy.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
You must hate your brothers.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
You're scared.
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Don't do that.
Do what?
I didn't sleep well.
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
Well, well.  Mrs. Brigman.
You wanna know what I think?
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
You owe me one, Virgil.
They'll come out after us.
How?
We've only got one suit.
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
How deep?
He's losing it.  Talk to him.  Keep him with us.
When do you have to go back?
A little more so this time.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
I mean, to stay away longer -- two months... a year... three years... Yes, I know, it sounds absurd. And I feel awful. The very idea of losing you makes me want to die... And yet... I... I just don't have the same feeling for you any more.
Four or five days.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
This looks to me like a good sign. Don't you think so? As far as I'm concerned, anyone who reads the Bible could not have committed an act of impropriety. Why... as a matter of fact, I remember when I was in China, many years ago, I happened to be involved in a similar situation, concerning an English woman, the wife of Ambassador Shafford, a good friend of mine. There, too, we found a Bible... And I said at the time that whatever had happened, that clue alone had definitely ruled out the possibility of... suicide. Why, it was logical, I said, that whoever reads the Bible believes in God and therefore...  No? You don't believe it? Well, as a matter of fact, I was right... The woman was found two days later. It was a case of amnesia.
Well, what?
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
Somebody must live here!
Don't be so humble.
How should I be ... arrogant?
And I suppose it's my fault... Why don't you tell him that too. That's what you believe, isn't it?
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
What is it, Claudia?
What! Get married?
You look at me as though I had said something foolish...
I'm too sleepy.
I love you.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
To do what?
But where did you finally end up?
You say that just to flatter me.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Please, you come too...
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
Corrado, why don't you ask them to give it to us as a gift?
There too...
You men are all so dreadful!
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
And why wouldn't we have one like this?
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
You know, I don't love anybody.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
No.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Of God.
It's not my time of month.
I don't know.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Who?
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Why should they?
I got sicker.
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Don't you know?
Agnes...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
Where do you think babies come from?
Why should I?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
No.
Do you?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I'm not sick.
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you?  If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you?  Did she make you do something you didn't want to?  Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it?  Did it embarrass you?  Did it... did it hurt you?  What did she make you you do?
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
No I'm not.
No I'm not.
And why am I here?
How did you have a baby?
Yes.
No.
Why?
Because I was afraid.
May I open my eyes now?
What made it grow?  Do you know?
Yes.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
And then what happened?
My bed.
Who?
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
Not your fault...
I put her to sleep.
Why?
Larry...
???
All I want is one more week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
No!
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
No.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
Two packs a day.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Is that normal?
Was there a priest?
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
What's your opinion?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
And in your eyes?
That possibility never occurred to you?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
This was before her pregnancy?
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
What?
Earthquakes?
Was the child full term?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
Listening to angels?
The woman's health is at stake.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Bullshit yourself!
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said?  She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
Long, thin and filtered.
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Begin what?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
My God, you're as crazy as...
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Why would I lie?
Did you know she was pregnant?
Before or after you killed the child?
Oh, don't do this!
Eh?
We'd be thrown out.
They're yours.
Bet you're only eight and a half.
Well --
I'm a deserter.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Sure.
Boys, you don't know what this means to me. If you hadn't come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
I don't care.
Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Have I said something amiss?
Ringo!
Is he?
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh they're a desperate crew of drippings and they've fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
Have they?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Oh, they seem all right to me.
What are you doing?
What's he on about?
Hello.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
No, that's his other one.
Clean though, isn't he?
Well, what are we waiting for?
What little old man?
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
If you're going to have a barney I'll hold your coats.
Of course, he's concealed about me person.
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Let's have you.
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
That's mine.
But...
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
What?
How's that?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Are you in pain?
Where's Irth?
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
What is it?
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Don't you remember?
How long to fix?
You like this shit?
It grows on you.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
And when will you be ready to do that?
So does anybody have any suggestions?
No, I don't want us separated.
Blood's thoroughly oxygenated.
God, that smoke's poisonous!
We can't go into hypersleep with that thing running around loose.
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
We'd better seal off the lower maintenance level; at least trap it there. 
I've completely lost their signal.
Air lock?
There, it caught!
I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log."
How?
It appears to be a heavy fluid of some sort... it blocks the X-rays...
These day and night cycles are totally disorienting.  I feel like we've been here for days, but it's only been how long?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
It's out of focus.
But?
Find anything we missed?
Chaz -- what happened to Broussard?
We can't leave him out here, open the door.
What film?
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
So the only question left is: who gets to crawl down the airshaft?
Let's hear it.
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Good argument for gun-control.  What are you going after, rhino?
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
A three-second burn to port, on my mark.
Something spooking the rhinos?
One of 'em must have escaped.
C'mon De Vries.  Think of the bonus.
Shit!  Our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  We got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that's it.
Is this the suit?
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Central Pumping.  All the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  If it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
Everything on this module is locked and sealed.  We've lost 'B', 'C', and 'E' wings, but 'E' was the only one we didn't manage to totally evacuate.
Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Agreed.
Hurry it up.
What can I do?
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
You're more than modest.
I don't think that's funny.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
We're?
Addison...
I'm in love with Lloyd!
Was the setting properly romantic - the lights on dimmers, gypsy violins off stage?
What do you take me for?
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
What of it?
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
That's not true!
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
It's the same thing, isn't it?
Feeling better, my dear?
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
Answer me this. What makes a man become a producer?
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
Then you've heard too.
I take it she read well.
In time she'll be what you are.
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
And cut that out right now.
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You're my girl, aren't you?
I leave in a week - the picture's all wrapped up, we previewed last night... those previews. Like opening out of town, but terrifying. There's nothing you can do, you're trapped, you're in a tin can-
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
I love you...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
Happy little housewife...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
Mad! Darling, there are certain characteristics for which you are famous - on stage and off. I love you for some of them - and in spite of others. I haven't let those become too important to me. They're part of your equipment for getting along in what is laughably called out environment - you've got to keep your teeth sharp. All right. But you will not sharpen them on me - or on Eve...
I mix what I like.
Now don't get carried away-
No, I'll tell it to you! For the last time, I'll tell it to you. Because you've got to stop hurting yourself, and me, and the two of us by these paranoiac tantrums!
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
Why you have to go out there.
Every day.
Yes. Yes, it does.
When I told you what every young actress should know.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
No.
She works hard.
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
You were just looking around...
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
You're not going, are you?
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up...  ... whose is it?
Karen.
The show must go on.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
Let's not get over-dramatic.
- an understudy's performance.
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Did you see it here in New York?
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
The curtains. I made them myself.
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
Hi.  Hello, darling-
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
She's just outside the door.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
What about Bill?
Why should he - and why should you?
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
You'll break your neck on that ice.
You know, I've been going over our financial condition - if you'll pardon the expression...
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Three days, that's for the bourgeois - I see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...
Who is it? What's it all about?
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Who's left out there?
When you do, let me in on it.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
To you, too?
That depends.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I placed...?
Look, Miss Channing... it's kind of depressing. If you don't mind my saying so, everybody's kind of dying on the vine...
A couple of weeks.
But what could she do?
I don't know if this would be a wise move...
--I sure couldn't hurt it, could I?--
What is it about my writing that's so rotten?
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
--see?--
--fifteen phone calls--
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
When?
'68.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
--there had to be a White House overseer--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
--Jesus--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
--all that crap, you're putting it in the paper? It's all been denied. You tell your publisher--tell Katie Graham she's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published. Good Christ! That's the most sickening thing I ever heard.
Night.
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
--Howard Hunt?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
Do you feel much about the things you did?
You wrote the Canuck letter--the one where you claimed Muskie slurred the Canadians.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
So tell me about the Times article.
What's this?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
Look, I told you inside--
--this should take only a minute, Mr. Dahlberg, but we're doing a follow- up on the break-in--  --and I was kind of curious about your check.
I see. And how do you think it reached Miami?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
--the Canuck letter--was that a White House operation--
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Your name, please.
James McCord.
I think so.
But it's possible.
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
...go on, go on...
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
Anyone but Bernstein.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
What else have you got?
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Sorry.
Thanks coach.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
Alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  You don't need to go to Lookout Point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
I had no idea you'd be this good!
What are we gonna hear?
Finch!  Get to the bathroom!  Now!
Me too.  For the most part.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
You can call me Oz.
I'm glad you think so.
You don't like it?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Uh...my dad's the manager.
You want onions?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
You're missing the game for us?!
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
And you said...
Pontificated.
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
You can send me the address too.
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Yeah, sure.
Son.  This lady's here for you.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Whatever you want.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Who cares?
After getting laid?
Shame on you!
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Nadia, I can't --
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Ho-lee shit.
Oh, Kev.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Ready for what?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Okay, explain.
...Guess what?
I'd use pills. They're painless.
Just like sex with my wife.
Either way works for us...
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
Serafine...
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
Holy mother of God...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Whoa...
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
Okay. Be careful.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Claude...?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Because Gaston was after it.
Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
Uncle Terrence, you're...
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Here.
Twelve thirty-six a.m. here. Twelve forty a.m. here. There's two of them. At least.
Are you running away?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Did I tell you that?
You'll laugh.
Yes, your highness.
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Just what do you think you're doing?!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
No! Well, yes, but
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Dmitri didn't want the money?
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
Trust me, it's her!
How do you know?
I cursed then all!
You'd lose your security deposit?
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
Promise me she'll have her home.
Are you impressed with our Anastasia?
What is so incredibly great about New York? It's a dying city! You-you read "Death in Venice".
It's an important issue.
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
Lyndon Johnson?
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie?  So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
Uh, you're driving a-
I'll getcha a piece.
Nice car.
Well...
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
Fifteen years?
Oh, yeah.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
H'm?
Yeah.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
And blind people, crippled...
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
M'hm.
Yeah.
That's the key question.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
How is it any different?
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Well, have you ever made love high?
Let's just do it, all right?
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
It's his name.
and I keep, you know, it's-
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
David! David! I can't believe this!
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Okay, okay. Okay.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Remember that day?
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
I'm late.
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
Oh, yeah?  Terrific.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Oh, you got a headache!
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
His wife has diabetes!
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Oh.
There's a whole wing in this house.
Yeah.
There were many men interested in you?
Was it a contractor?
It's the way they do things.
What's that?
She's a constant surprise.
I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
What?
Not this time.
Honey?
Oh.
Well, probably.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Thanks for coming.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
What a nose.  You missed your calling.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Harry called.
She left a note.
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Do you want me to save you?  Do you want me to save you?
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
A perfect night.
Hm.  Do you like fucking out of doors?
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest.
The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them.
Did he promise?
Accept a compliment.
Don't get it.
What?
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Otis!!!!
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
It's a novel.
You think this was to hurt you?!  My God, Joe.  It isn't about you.
That's under lock and key.
Will you make love with me?
Has she called?
Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Ours.
You got your DP?
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
You must have been a baby.
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
I'm so glad.  You know, I recognize that passage in your book.  The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
Yes.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Panes is here!
How?
Fuck you, Panes.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
You're keeping a record, are you?
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Break's over.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
Well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  I miss him already.
You're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
And you are...?
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
I -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
Five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  About five thousand four hundred by now.
You were right...you were right!  Z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
You held onto this all that time?
Of course not --
Bala has always been a hopeless romantic, General.
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Be honest, kid -- am I hurt bad?
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
So this Z...he fancies himself an individual?
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
I can't think of any.
What do I do?
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
Care to make a small wager?
Say, you got a lulu.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Good night.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town --  I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise.  Cheers.
One more?
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
Much better.
This is a bad day for me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
I just want to go brush my teeth --
Baxter.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
A cemetery?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
What for?
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Sure.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
For me?
Are you supposed to?
You did?
Over a girl?
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
Oh.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
I don't know.
You do?
That's right, Baxter.
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
Well -- I guess so.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
I got kicked in the head, too.
I see.
I dig.
Now you're being bright?
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch.  You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
She going to be all right, Doc?
How do you spell her last name?
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor.  By the way, whatever happened to her?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No.
Family?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
And what happened to you?
Yes, I know.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
I missed you, Fran.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Are you sure that's what you want?
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
All set for what?
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Go where?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
You let me go four years ago, Jeff. Only you were cruel enough to make me sit out there and watch the new models pass by.
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this is Captain -- eh --
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes --
I like all of them --
Winning the war by yourself.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
I was an FO for the 25th.
Who's he?
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Get in there !
I only met Kurtz once.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
You know much about about Special Forces; Green Berets, Captain ?
Yeah.
He couldn't get through a sentence without all these big words; about why we kill.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
Captain?
What, sir?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
Haiphong.
Can you trust them?
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Who?
Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?
Colonel Kurtz, I guess.
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
What Truth?
Fuck no.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You knew him best.
His death was -- yes, he died as he lived.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
So Kurtz is alive.
What if I say no.
Well, you know I don't have the priority to do that, sir. It says here not to contact Com-Sec- Int. Who's your commanding officer ?
What show ?
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
Remember that demon in the gut? Sometimes it's nothing more than wondering if the so-called civilized life has bred the balls and brains out of you.  That's what you want out of this, isn't it?
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
Did you catch Corbett?
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
I still can't believe I'm being financed by an oil company. Especially when they get a look at these pictures.  Technology in the wilderness; not too pretty.  What's that?
Maybe you should drive him into Devil's Cauldron, let them decide what to do with him.
Oh, Christ, sweetheart.  Four days!  I thought you were dead, or worse.
What's going on?
Where's Corbett?
Go ahead.  Take the jeep.  I'll come to Cache with Bob when he gets here.
Ben Corbett?
Surviving is what I know --
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
There's a cabin, maybe twenty miles south of here.
Where's my ELT?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
It was blown up with the plane.
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
I got it from here.  Thanks.
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
Have you heard anything from the girl staying with me, Anne Marie?
What's wrong?
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
Fuck you.
Why the smirk?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
...Ben never sent a signal.
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I'm sorry.
Do you love me?
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
Why did yo do this for me?
I'm not kidding.
My son.
What's that got to do with it?
I was going to do that for you.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Nonsense!
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Fries.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
Hello.
I should've danced with you.
What do you want, Melvin?
Because...
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
I've got to sketch you.
No. No. Get Carol.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  Assault and battery and you're black.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
She's nice.
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
How you doing, great one?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
Do you realize that I work at him?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Go away.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  But the tiredness -- boy...  Not just sleepy.
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
What are you doing?
Bain.  Michael Bain.
What are you doing?
If you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
Where have you been, Robert?
Yeah.
Twenty large?  That's all?
'Them'?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
How?
Electra.
Why?
It's not the same, is it?
Because that's how it works.  That's what it's about.  He was the best. He was on top.
Why not?
Yes.  It didn't matter much to them as long as I disappeared.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
Is that what you wanted to hear? Something cold blooded... something remorseless...
Several.
Hey, where are you?
In Costa Blanca.
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
You should knock.
I've always wanted to learn something like that.
Transmits and receives.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.
Aiiee.  More waiting?  I don't know if I like this plan.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
Ten years ago, I sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
What happened?
Ten years later, here you are again.
I think I got one today.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Because, I'll take it.
Yes.
Yes.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Was she the only one?
Uh-huh.
I wasn't watching television.
I prefer it like this.
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
Can I ask you something?
American currency.
A coke, if they have it?
Cheers Katka!
So how's your work?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Like you?
Anything in it?
Squatted it.
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
So?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
Yep, except a name for this place.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Have you ever stolen anything?
What happened to Katka?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
He got that one right.
Did you see a lawyer and go before a judge?
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
WE gotta think of something.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Sure....Anything else I can do for you?
God, I think I need a holiday.
Some deal you did there!
What about me?
What are you talking about?
You're sure?
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
She's tired.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
It's not so much.
Yeah, it's a simple piece. If they get the floor done in time, me and the others will rehearse tomorrow afternoon, but it's not critical.
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?
What for?
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
Did you take your things over to my place?
Where did you steal the car?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
Why did you break into that particular building?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
Sure!
Josh!
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
It's more than what you're worth.
Josh, I need your help. Doug's been arrested, he's in big trouble. I thought maybe your father and the Embassy might be able to do something.
Yes, if you can get him free.
You are quite sure it's secure?
All the more reason to eliminate him.
So go dance.
She's coming over here...
She asleep?
'Bout what?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
To see your father?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I'm thinking.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You don't know me.
'Is it really me?'
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
What is that?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
What does that mean?!
Excuse me?
I don't understand...
Assholes. This happen to you?
Where?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
I've talked to your father.
How you doing?
It's gone now.
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
It was a play.
Praying.
Where did you get -- ?
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
Scalene?
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
Huh?
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Hi, Marty!
Learn anything?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
Oh -- right! Uh, Madison 3489.
Operator, what's today's date?
What?!
The plutonium! That's what I came over here for! Professor, where did you get that stuff?
So what? We'd be rich!
Jeez -- this is where you used to live, huh? You must have been rich!
A mall?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
Say, where did this guitar come from?
Where did you get this?
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
There's no way of knowing.
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Me neither. I've always wondered whether they slept together before they got married. You think yours did?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Yeah.
That's what he told you, huh?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Then why'd you do it?
I need to get your signature on some papers here, Kit.
Okay.
Yeah. I can imagine.
It's okay.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
I came in the front.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Positive?
Yes.
That's Montana over there.
It was going too fast.
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Yeah.
You're my friend, aren't you?
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Was she pretty?
You don't wanna know.
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
Believe in Penny Priddy?
Stay here, I'll be back.
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
John Whorfin will kill us!
What's his problem?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
...Hello.
What DID you mean?
Well that's what he said.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the –
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
I didn't say anything-
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Go ahead, son.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
...That's fine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
And I could tell you some stories –
Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic thing.  Goes away for a while, but it always comes back. Gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. Don't worry, it's not contagious.
...Yeah, okay.
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, but –
No!... I'm fine. Thank you.
I believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
Everything's okay, believe me. I know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
You gotta get a grip on, brother. You gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till I get back. Try and stay here, keep your door locked. Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
But Charlie – why me? Why –
I'm at the Earle.
Yeah... rye whiskey?
Yes sir, they –
Yes sir.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Well, some of his throat was there.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
There's no smoking in this building.
Did you find out about her parents?
How are you, Nick?
Catherine Tramell.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
You did it for me.
I thought you hardly know her.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
I don't smoke.
You know all about me.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You tell me.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
I like you.
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
Fine.
What did you pay Nilsen?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
No.
Fine.  How's your back?
You're in over your head.
You won't believe me.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
It won't sell.
Why?
How did it end?
You have the right to an attorney.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
I don't know.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
I don't believe it.
I know what happened.  Catherine told me what happened.
What do you want?
So what do we do -- nothing?
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
Anderson.  Jack W. Donald M.  I'm sorry.  No Lisa.
Can there be some mistake?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
Naa..
You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
What's wrong?
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Is Jean Michel here?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Do you think I could borrow your limousine? I'll get it back to you in an hour.
I didn't see you.
... Can you... decipher this for us?
What are they?
A primate?
Or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
Hey – Willie Mays.
The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic – writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..
"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!
You got a date already?
Your people.
You gonna carry that around all night?
I don't really have any problems.
I guess you did.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
I'm your family.
What's that about?
Is that the best quality you have?
I'll take the whole tin.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Wanna Mac?
I don't eat junk food.
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
Jean? Hold this, please.  You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.
I just don't think you're being fair.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Well, I'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
And the truth frightened her?
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
He napalmed my arm.  He knocked me off a building just when I was starting to feel good about myself. I want to play an integral part in his degradation.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
A lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  By the way, how's Fred Adkins, your old partner?
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Precisely.  But they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I've provided.  That shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
Max!  Relax!  Josh and Jen'll put a spin on this.  We'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
Working late?  I'm touched.
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Is there something wrong, sir?
I am as well as can be expected.
Women.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Glandular secretions from animals. Scents that create powerful emotions.  Fear.  Rage...
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
You'd be surprised.
What are you talking about?
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Alfred's happy here.
Pow!  What!  Kazow!
Mr. Bane, I'll finish off the city. You, as they say in showbiz, are on.  Take the boys and kill the kids. But bring me the Bat.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
Of course.  He's going to steal the giant white diamond.
How did you...?
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
An enticing offer.  But what does the lady want in return?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Too much wealth. Too fast. Half of Gotham zombied-out. A technology that self destructs. He's protecting more than industrial secrets, Alfred.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
There's one other thing. I feel..
...A bat.
What?
Mystery.
And another name for Mystery?
Welcome, Master Grayson. I'm Alfred.
What's wrong?
Help Chase. I'll be back.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
For _me_? Really? Tell me.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Mr. Nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. But what exactly is on your mind?
The infamous Wayne charm. Does it ever shut off?
Wacko? That a technical term?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
What?
What?
Back off, man.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Chase?
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mr..uh...Face.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
... How long have I been out?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
I loathe bats.
They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Do you want a drink?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
As much as I do.  It's not that.  I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Evildoers, huh?  Big or small?
Where does one man get all this junk?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Peanuts?
Right.  And they know him.  And that's why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy Bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
David, I'm serious!
Sort of half.....
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
Ahm....
It's you and Mom that need to talk.
Sure did.
Yes?
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.  Going on To my regiment/s reunion after.
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't know Anderson had a Camper.
Ow! These chips suck.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Uh, you first.
Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh huh.
You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get alcohol, tobacco and guns!
Butt-dumpling...
Bunghole...
Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
...Two...
Talk ta me, Bork.
Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to fall into the wrong hands...
Bork! You are a federal agent. You represent the United States Government... Never end a sentence with a preposition. Try again.
That's better. Yes?
Cool, huh huh huh.
Really? That's where we're from.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
No, Jane.
That's how long you were gone.
<u>You</u> left me.
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Are you crazy?  She can't hear you.
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Little black party dresses?
3:30 I guess.
Nobody else can.
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
We have to start simpler, is that it?
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
Just get some people out of our house.
We're very unhappy.
-- Like you used to be?
About what?
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
Are you a spirit too?
That's it!
Your qu...?  But you're...
Otho, you've got to help me get Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
... sheets.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I don't care from guilt.  I just want to <u>see</u> them.
Lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Well there's a Little Deetz at least.  Boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
Thomas Franklin, an attorney.
An attorney?
Yes.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
... But he's...?
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
A Black man gave me the message.
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
Your leg must be getting better.
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be...  I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Of course. But since he is ill I'm taking the liberty of asking you.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Oh, I see.
Hello, Ronald.
Of course not! No one has the time to read! One glances at things, watches television...
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
What about money?
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
Good morning, Louise.
I'd like to thank you for filling in on such short notice for the Vice President.
No. I don't object.
Yes.
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
Since you were a child?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Have you served in the Army?
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
That is correct. In a garden, growth has its season. There is spring and summer, but there is also fall and winter. And then spring and summer again...
And look who you brought with!
... Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
So...? Where the hell is it?
... So what does all that add up to?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
It's that serious, huh?
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I'm pretty sure it was you. Hey, could I get your autograph now? It's for .... oh, what the hell, it's for me! I'm your biggest fan!
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
What?
Which one is Elijah again?
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Did you eat?
I was worried.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
So how was it? What was he doing?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
What are you doing?
What's that?
We?
Suck my dick!
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
Holy shit, yes!
Schwartz.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yessir.
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester...
What?
You married?
What'll you have?
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Sure. It'd be fun.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
You can be John Malkovich.
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Ah.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Can I get you a drink?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
You still there, sweets?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
I likes yellow.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
You saying nothing counts?
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
YOU CAME BACK BECAUSE OF ME?
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Well, good luck with the job.
What you want?
Yes ma'am.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.
But mama..
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
I know what I see.
It's cold as charity in there! What he do that for? Any number'll take him in.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
I don't know him that well.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
That's so.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
For what?
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Leave off..
She left me. She's gone again.
What the hell you thinking, girl? Strolling in here this late?
What? What? You talking back to me?
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.
Make it the way I always do.
Yeah.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
Fuckin' A.
He peed on the Dude's rug--
What the fuck is he talking about?
They were Nazis, Dude?
What do you need that for, Dude?
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Uh-huh.
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
In the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Far from it.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
"Johnson"?
I was talking about my rug.
You're not interested in sex?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
A hundred.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Jeffrey--
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Well...no, of course not--
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner. In fact I don't want the father to be someone I have to see socially, or who'll have any interest in rearing the child himself.
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
Walter, this is not a guy who built the rail- roads, here, this is a guy who peed on my--
You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
You mean--beyond pacifism?
No, you're not wrong--
Huh?
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
It's your roll--
The what?
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks up our plan.
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Now Dude--
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
Who the fuck is that?
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Yeah.
Uh.
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm not even supposed to pick up the phone, unless it's an emergency.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I wouldn't've done it if I knew he was a fucking crybaby.
What's mine is mine.
Walter Sobchak.
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam anybody here, I'm just--
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Dude.
Mind if I smoke a jay?
WHAT?!
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Why?
Where to first?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Thank you.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
Why do you hate us so much?
What do you really think?
You ask me, you and Miss Muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.
I am worrying.  Seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
An inevitability, I suppose.  Nyssa was not among them, I trust.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Hey, you think I don't know what's at stake here?  We practically compromised our whole operation to save your puckered old ass!  And for what?
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Going on twenty years now.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Stupidity.
I don't buy it.
Pass.
Hold out your hands.
But I just got here --
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
And that's a good thing?
What do you see here?
How can you tell?
You don't look so good.
No --
I was afraid that might happen.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
You're a monster.
So what do you use, then? A stake?
We keep in radio contact.
He killed them?
--bad boys, mean boys, <u>cowardly</u> boys--just like Domini.
What do you mean?
What's she look like?
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
Oak?
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
Druid Hill Park.
That's a joke?
No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
You want me to scooch over next to you?
I want to see the tapes.
We're leaving--case dismissed for lack of evidence. Maybe on the ride home we can figure how the fuck we're going to graduate with no thesis.
Nothing. I dunno--
I want to see something!
I can't.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
Can't you like just divine it?
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
What I never could figure about the movie?
No fucking.
What about night?
--Cotter: shut up.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
It's <u>freezing</u>.
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
What're you doing?
What?
You planning on sleeping out there?
He'll never know.
Jesus.
That's why she kills children.
Sure. I'm sorry.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Why in the world would <u>she</u>--
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
Yes.
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
You can stay at my place, I'll drop you there.
What?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Thanks.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
When you don't they're usually nice.
...That's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--Where the hell's my windbreaker?
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
Remy.
I own the place.
Sure don't.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
...I don't know. Sometimes I think there's something wrong with him. Like maybe he's sick? Mentally?... Or is it maybe me, do you think?
I'll figure something out... How come you offered to drive me in this mess?
See, I never knew that.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
I want you to go fishing.
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...it's too damn risky.
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
Deuce in the corner needs help.
What.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
...Why?
Doctor Gynde. my whole family's sick. What's going on?
See you Tuesday, Frank.
It must be great.
Okay.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
No. not at all.
Who knows you have these?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Oh he forced you, huh?
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Jeffrey nothing.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
THEN WHAT?
Do you like that?
Don?
Yes.
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
I sure don't hate you.
I want you to hurt me.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
I did. are you?
Okay. soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Raymond! Where's the fuckin' beer?
How is Central these days?
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
Oh yeah. What about those other people? . Anything?
What happened to him?
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
Are you alright?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
Why not?
Could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I'm going to wait here until she comes.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
What did you see?
Yes.
That's what I thought.
What am I going to do?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You worry about me really?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Probably not. no. Why?
... Sandy?.
Look Jeffrey.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Well. Okay.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Can I use the car tonight?
I mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Where do you guys want to count?
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
What can I do for you guys?
Goodness.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
I heard.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a cheeseburger or something.  What does she weight, eighty pounds?
What's that?
I don't want to talk about it.
Twenty-six months.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
Now do you see what I am saying?
We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know someone there.
How are we doing?
You need to come down here, everybody meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha. We do one for good faith and then we talk about airplanes.
I just got released five minutes ago.
Please, continue.
This is only part of the business, George.  A very small part.  Don't worry, there is so much more to do. Which reminds me, I need a favor from you.  I must go to Colombia.
What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do the talking.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Coke.
In how long?  A week?
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
It's beautiful.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Not mad.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
Figured it out.
It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal. What are you gonna do with all this?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
I don't know.  My name is George.
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
How are you doing?
Just to walk with you.  I want to be your dad again.
Where are you going?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
You swear?
I didn't mean to...
Listen, Americano, it is very nice to meet you, but maybe we are going too fast.  You take a little and then come back.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
No shit, Kevin?
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
And here?
Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... my colleagues continue to ask the same allusive questions, to which you can only respond in an allusive manner. I think it would be better to call things by their right names; if one means torture, then one should call it torture.
Sail.
Third group. What's your assignment?
What ... What must I decide?
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
I don't do that kind of thing.
Then don't complain.
Can you read?
Read it.
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
Because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.
Where were we?
What is she saying?
It could've happened to anyone.
You got something on the coke?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
The official cause?
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
-- And if he were in the midst of making love while under the influence of cocaine?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
He was away on an extended vacation and just returned two days ago.
No questions.
Objection, Your Honor.
She's innocent.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Can I go?
No -- but I can get it for you.
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
Who found him?
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
How long were you together?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
Intense.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
How did your relationship with Miss Lawson progress after the surgery?
It didn't.
Why not?
Yes.
She was.
Yes -- several times.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
You'll be sorry?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
He video taped you.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I've been to a few -- yes.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
A.M -- or P.M.?
What do you have in your purse?
Why'd you come here?
Frank -- what are you doing here?
Something like that.
Can we get out of here?
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Something wrong?
I'm dropping the case.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Really?
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
Humped
I'll talk to him later.
Is that alright, Frank?
No.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, I can help.
How bizarre!
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
Don't say that!
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
Did we want to?
See. Money don't buy happiness. I must say, she's taking it well.
She's changed.
Oh, yes.
Heat is heat.
How long you been married?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
Oh, that's nice.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
Where are you staying while you're here?
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
Smells like dirt.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Francesca?
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
What?
You're somewhere else, where?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Stop it!
What do you want me to say?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
What time is it?
I'm going to miss you.
Hmm?
Are you nuts?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
That's what?
But that's your old hood, Pops.
Those 'fools' are my people.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
All that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  That was your mama's bag.  I don't know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
Must be my clothes line.  No?  How bout my phone line?
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Wait, Jimmy.  Think about it.  You woulda done the same thing if you was me.
Aren't you going to join us?
They seemed alright.  Bring a little life to that old building.
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
It's alright, baby.
You got his hands.  Beautiful hands.  I didn't even know.  That night.  When they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  Life's like that. Grows right out of death.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
No.  It goes way back.  Or so my Momma says.
What else does she say?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I can't find you.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Bullshit, Dad.  Don't front me.  For once.  Just tell me the truth.  I came from there, too.
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me...
What the hell do you want?
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
Not that I remember.
There wasn't any draft.  That window was closed.
You want to get into this now?
Open the case!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
There's no time.
They just left, didn't they?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Goddammit, Violet!  Would you just leave me the fuck alone!  Please! Leave!  Now!
The money?  The money's gone.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Fuck.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Shut up, Violet!
Stupid cunt!
You need the money just like we do.
Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino!
They were in a car accident.
Yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry.
You can't kill me yet.
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Call me as soon as you get him.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Mmmm ...  thanks, I needed this.
Truck.
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
I don't.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar.  He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
He hung it up.
Johnnie?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
That's his brother.
Yeah.
He totally freaked.  I've never seen him like this.  He's out of his fucking mind.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
Hey.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Caesar wants me to stay.
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
I won't hurt you.
What if I say no?
Shit --  Can I tell you how much you're freaking me out?  Okay?  Because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
Listen to what you want.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
I should go.
Look, I don't know what's up there.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
I trusted you.
Oh, Jesus...
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx...
What?
What?
-- what're you talking about? --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
...ergency procedures.
...Yer nostril?
What? You mean you've got ...
What do I have to do.
You don't have to sing it.
Too late? That's for me to say.
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
How do you mean?
You killed him?
He's a freelance subversive?
What's she done?
Er ... but I would've found out anyway.
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Do you know what you're doing.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
Stamped?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
Are you alright?
It's you ... it's you ...
Yes. Ceiling. Why did you run away?
Why?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Well, no system is.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Well, terrorists of course.
What?
Will you please turn back.
Now you're the one that's out of your mind.
What?
They're gone.
Oh my God, a mistake!
He is dead.
It's what you wanted isn't it?
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
Alright. There's someone I want to check out. A woman called Gillian Layton.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
My I.D. cards.
Excuse me, Dawson, can you put me through to Mr Helpmann's office?
Now look what you've done to him.
It's okay. I'll just get my things out of the locker.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
Is she dying?
Es impossible.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
He looks like a cop.
Is this what you gave Mary?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Okay, what happened?
What's his name?
You look so different.
He's better.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
How long you been doing this?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
We just saved a little baby boy. Think of it that way.
That guy I brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. He's gone.
Oh Jesus, put her on the monitor. Where's the pediatric code cart?  Odette give me that tube. All right, flatline--let's do CPR. step back, Frank. How many months?
You can't believe how much he's improved.
No.
I'm sorry.
The cure's not working, Tom. Maybe we should go back to the hospital.
I've taken that into consideration.
Who with?
Do it!
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
You're in the stomach! Let me try.
Shit, shit, shit...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
No?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.  That's a promotion!
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Why do you say that?
This conversation is not worthy of you.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Define your terms.
No.
Don't go.
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Really?
Stop it.
Outside?
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
I understand.  I'll go with you.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
What?
Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
I like "godsend."
If we could just eat first.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
One year...almost one year.
I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It was totally impressive.  Great piece.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
Yes.
It's not important.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Yes.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
Then give me a minute...
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
What, right now?
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Um...
Alright we're clear.
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Are you ready?
Nice night out...
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
That's word for word.
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Are you alright?
Well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
What's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
I mean it's like, you know, I do my art because that's what I am, you know?  I'm an artist.  I'm not like a banker, you know.  Like I create.
I know, man.
You...made that?
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
Hiya Carla.
It's hot in here...
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Well, w-what did you do?
Yeah?
I want that cat.  I'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
I can't talk right now.
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
How ya doin'?
Hello, Walter.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
I- don't know what you're talking about!
I got you cold, pal.  Make it easy for yourself, use your head.
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I won't say good luck, Walter.
Why not?
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here...
If you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
What's all the noise in here!
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I had him in my grasp.
... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  You going?
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
They're all the same!  They're so stuck up, they're just... they're not even human.  I hate them.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
Yes.
Nothing.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You left me a message?
You're even weaker than the others.
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Hi.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
Are you okay?
Don't be such a fraidy-cat.
You're weird and I'm afraid of you. Seriously, Cassandra, there's a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
) What do you think?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
I'm glad you guys are here.  It's good to see you.
I'm looking for you, actually.
Wait!
Just stay away from me, okay?
China.
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
It's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
Don't you see what's happening? You're changing.  You've got powers you've only just begun to tap. Physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.  God, this hurts.  I've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I'm sorry I have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Buffy...
I...
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
There isn't time.
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
Wait!
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
I don't get it.
Cassandra's really smart.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
Hi.
My parents have money...
Really?
I'm just a girl.
Could be.
Oh, baby!
And Spring Fling.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I never thought of that.
The don't.  You kind of wish they would, though.
Oh, God.
The homelesses?
What are you talking about?
I'm leaving, man.  I'm bailing town. This place has gotten way too hairy.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
How was that?
I know what it is.
Fundamentals?
No!  You're playing with my mind!
It's Skip, for you.
Well I guess this is it.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
She's dancing with me.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
Damn.
You got me all confused.
Who are you?  Do you have a job?
I doubt that.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Oh dear....easy honey...
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Which one of us?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
I didn't spit on you!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Beg me again!
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
How come you don't like me?
I was great, eh?
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
You fuck!
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Take the first shot at me.
No.  If I screw up, I wanta do it alone.  I'll call.
Can I give you my testimony?
Little high.
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
It's a damn convention.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
What'you want, kid?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
You were wandering around.
Was I at that dinner?
As far as the world was concerned Andy Stone, the head of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, was a legitimate guy.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Watch it, partner, watch it!
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Yeah.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.
I know she's there. Don't fuck around with me.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
You know, havin' some fun with it, shit like that.
They payin'?
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
...the next thing I did, I started bustin' out high-stakes poker players.
Then he called me a faggot.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
No, I don't wanna come -
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
Listen, I would -
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
What people?
Oh, I don't know whether you know this or not, but you only have your fuckin' casino because I made that possible!
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
You never - ?
I just told you. She called me.
And what'd she want?
Hello.
Sammy.
Well...
Before we point the dirty end of the stick at 'ol Don, uh, we better be sure we can prove them charges.
You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
But, sir. Well, I don't know why. I guess, maybe, because she's frightened that if she doesn't lose the weight she may even get fired.
Why not make them happy?
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What are you talkin' a- ?
Huh?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
Okay.
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
...on the stuff involving crimes. So on...
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Pretty serious.
Yeah.
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
I was with somebody.
You are not threatening me anymore!
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
After all the threats and all the bullshit, it turned out Ginger didn't tell 'em anything. But by then, the Feds didn't need her, anyway.
Eight children! 
It won't happen again, Sam.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.
Excuse me.
I just wanna get out of here.
Mm.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
Hey... you got a minute? Hey. He's got two million in the box, am I right?  Okay, you let him keep your jewels. We take the cash and the only other thing he cares about.  Huh?  Her majesty. We go to Europe. You dye your hair, get some pl-
I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.]
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
What're you gonna do? Strong-arm me?
Mrs Ro- Mrs Rothstein! Okay, shh!
Fucker!
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
Sir, you're gonna have to leave. You mind accompanying us outside?
Forget about it, Nick. Don't let it bother you.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
I want to know... if he's doin' all right. If he's okay.
No problem.
I understand.
I mean, unless Ace made his bet.
Ace.
I'll be right out.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Sure.
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I do.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
I do. I need a new sponsor.
Is that what you want?
Hey, don't be such a fuckin' smartass, will you?  I mean, I know the fuckin' guy thirty-five years, I'm gonna fuckin' whack him for you?  Fuck... motherfucker! I knew this, I knew it.
You fucked with me for the last time!
I'm sorry.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Well, how 'bout that?
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
It means I got the money.
He was just on the phone.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
And this is Stacy.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Yeah, but they're complaining.
He asked me again about you and the Jew's wife.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
Take it easy!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
I'm positive.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I'm not going to worry about it. We are quite beyond the computer disc. Everything will be over within the next hour or so.
You say that like an amnesia victim.
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
This is insane. Let the heroes handle it.  I'd better get you home...I should check on my warehouse to make sure it hasn't been hit...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
Selina, are you okay?
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I thought cats were supposed to have nine lives, not thirty one!  What do you think you're doing?
What do you want from me?
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
A genuine woman of mystery in Oasisburg.  Amnesia. Bulletholes in exposed stomach badly concealed with body make-up.  Beautiful, intelligent eyes that have no business in "Frank's Fun Palace" or anybody else's Fun Palace for that matter..
Like you don't know...
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I give up. I give up.--I can't figure you out. Not gonna try.
Not too cool...
Is every single thing out of your mouth since your "accident" have to be a monotone mumble of cheap sarcasm?
Don't sneak up on me...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
Any place.
I know.  But it's an emergency. Somebody dying.  Okay?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
He's at it again.  Like that night at the Emerald.  This piece of Euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so Mr. Good Deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  Meantime "Wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  It took six stitches.
Then whose is it?
You switched license plates?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
And what're you whispering for?
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
A woman?
I suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
What bank?
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
They dragged me downstairs.  I thought they were going to kill me.
God, if he doesn't come back --
Are you okay?
Yes sir.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
It's locked.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Whose money is this?
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Do you have to point that?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
That's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Who'd ever think, to look at you?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Naturally.
I'm handling it.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
Didn't we play this scene before?
Where do we meet?
I'm here.  Where are you?
We don't see you.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
Negative.
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
Who am I talking to?
If he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus Lenore here.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
You want us to get ourselves killed?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Who's this?
Why would she want me to think you were on ice?
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
How far off are you?
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
I already called for an ambulance.
Can I make a quick call?
So who's he?
See what, Dil?
He agreed that he was.
Yeah. Fuck it, Dil.
Fuck off, Dave.
Thank you.
See, they get the wrong idea.
No.
Not me.
Give me that look again.
What's that about?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
He was different.
You say that like a gentleman.
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
I'm thinking of your man.
No...
I didn't mean to hit you.
Make it up to me, then.
When?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
So they do know.
Won't be quite the same though, will it?
Don't ask me in.
No. Can't pretend that much.
Should have stayed a girl.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
Happy now?
What's her?
Shouldn't be, Dil
You do something for me, Dil?
Why?
I had to go to work!
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Prescription. For my condition.
What?
In a manner of speaking.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
You know her, Jimmy?
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
Can't.
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Perfect.
And what if you don't?
Who's the old geezer?
I take pride in my work.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
Why would you do that?
So?
Yes.
Peter.
I thought it was Dave.
I understand.
Definitely unusual.
And who is she?
A hotel?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
This is a farce, man.
What's that?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
Could you?
Hey --
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Not in your nature.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No.
What?
She'd be anyone's type.
She's a friend of mine
What the fuck were you doing here?
Never.
Hurry up, would you?
Where would you most like to be now, man?
Having a pint in the Rock.
We got simple tastes, you and me.
Want you to do something, Fergus.
I told you not to talk that way --
I thought as a child. But when I became a man I put away childish things...
Stop that talk now --
The fastest.
Don't run off, Jude.
It was fun while it lasted.
You're crazy --
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
When you come on, you really come on.
You're going to look for him -- now?
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
His -- real -- ?
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
But I don't have it.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
Were you followed?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
No.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
But no one actually saw him die.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Very good.
Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
Then how do I know this is your office?
What's your first name today?
Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
No.
Oh.
Do I knock or something?
Carson Dyle is dead.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Scobie?
Does it hurt?
Alexander.
There must be some way.
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Whitefoot, of course.
Okay.
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
Then I suggest you call one of them.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
Why don't you shut up!
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Forty-five thousand.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
Meaning what?
Yes.
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Of course it is.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list 
How's that?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
Oh. I guess.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
We'll find you a hotel.
What are you doing in here?
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
How do you shave in there?
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
What are you talking about?
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.  If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Yeah? What's that?
Shoot no, not after all these years.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
Hi Jody.
Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
Your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
How much further?
Ok.
You found her?
She's still a virgin.
She's not here.
She was murdered?
No, you couldn't.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Why?
But I shouldn't shut it down?
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
I don't watch him eat everyday.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
I promised I'd go right home after school.
Someone tried to kill me.
Didn't you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep the old town papers?
Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering about it all day.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
Did Sharon say no?
You know I want to go with you.
Go to the police station!
Lisa Sherman?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Where are you going?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
The word is Mob.
I got to go.
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Maybe it won't stay in.
I know. I'm kidding you. Chill out.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?
 Oh...
...shit.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Freezer in the back.
...and fair...
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
...and a shitload of ice.
...truck.
Peace.
I need your truck!

What the hell's goin' on?
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
...-er.
You stole this truck! That's...



Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
You wanna hit me?

...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
...Shift.
Come on, old Pete.
Left, left, left!
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
 

 Shit. 
All right.

Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...here!


Okay.
So you took his...
I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
...hospital.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
We got two paddles.
That is loud!  I'm 
All right, all right.  Hey, hey.
A-And you  owe me...
 




You just can't leave that stuff with that lu-...
Sometimes the prey bites back.
...-ful?!
Oh, shit.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
Shoot me. 
Mason.
What?

You did help a little.
Who drove the ice cream...
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
My code name was Blackjack.  Night Shift was my coach.  Uh-Uh-Uh, I'm sorry. Mason was my coach.
We're worried...
What'd he say?

So...where's my truck?
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
Is it--?
Any of them Richard Long?
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
You'll kill us all!
Oh, I'm well aware of what the government did, I assure you.  Actually, I've just come to say how grateful I am to you...
Went away? 
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.

Sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  Fur-...
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
I wanna patch in from...
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
We were called in by the Jerome base...
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...scientists.
Where's their protective...
It's a hundred degrees...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I beg your pardon?
I assume you have one.
...Long.
I want you to look at one another...
...to die for a country that's...
Where's Arlo?
 ...checked. 

Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
There's something else too.
Sir, I got Taipei grindin' on me here. How long is this supposed to ta--?
...now!
Great.  All right...
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.
Missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  I told you Mason was walking shit.
Uh-huh.
A man named Tim Ma-...
Excellent.
...back...
...is death.
...-to a simple thing like...
Mason.
Yeah, I just....
We've got the real thing!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
...there's a colonel...
...we're all gonna die in this...
All right, go.



 We've gotta take out Brynner's van before  they reach...
Look at that.
Tell me. What do the police say?
Would you call him a capable man?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Just find the girl, Mr. Gittes. I think she is frightened and I happen to know Hollis was fond of her. I'd like to help her if I can.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Just find the girl.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Oh, my, yes.
The future, Mr. Gittes. The future. Now where's the girl?... I want the only daughter I have left... as you found out, Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
She's just no good.
Oh they don't?
Where's that?
Off the alley.
Hello, Jake.
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?
I'd like to talk to him.
Oh yeah? Can you think of something to charge me with?
You accusing me of extortion?
And why's that?
I know what he says.
What's the maid's address?
What?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
Mrs. Mulwray?... Mrs. Mulwray.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
I got your check in the mall.
I have?
Why?
Unless what?
Did he know?
Is there anything else you want to know?
Where you were when your husband died.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
What dam?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
Maid's night off?
Why?
Working for the District Attorney.
Yeah.
Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
The Albacore Club.
The police?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
With us.
How do you know?
Sophie.
Oh no.
Who?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
Would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
And Mulwray isn't?
I'm sorry, I --
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
Si.
The water.
Yeah. Banged up pretty bad.
I'm afraid so.
Mrs. Mulwray, do you love your husband?
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
He's not in, Mr.?
Gittes.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Since lunch.
Yes. No.
He did or he didn't?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
What about?
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
We don't publish a record in the paper, I can tell you that.
Neither do I.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Did you ever see her again? 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Father, I have sinned...
But...who...
I don't care. I'll wait.
So what'd they say?
No. And I'm not married.  Are you happy?
No...
See how pretty the house is? We did everything over.  If it hadn't been for you!  Come, I have a surprise....  You must be tired. If you want to rest, there's time before the funeral.
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein.  I'm dictating it.
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
You know how long it took the "Chronicle" to get that staff together?  Twenty years.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
Enthusiastic?
Yes, very!  Naturally.
From before the beginning, young fellow. And now it's after the end.  Anything you want to know about him - about the paper -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
He made an awful lot of money.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Sixty-two thousand -
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Hello, Mr. Leland.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers.  I believe you.
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
I want to be a singer.  I mean, I didn't.  Mother did for me.
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you.  What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at?  It's only money.  It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
Susan, it seems to me -
Anything you say, Mr. Kane.  Only we're talking now about what you are.  That's what the note is about, Mrs. Kane.  Now I'm going to lay all my cards on the table.  I'm fighting for my life.  Not just my political life.  My life.  If your husband is elected governor -
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
As Charles Foster Kane, who has 			eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you.  Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him.  You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
Yes, sir. 
It's a wall you bought in China, Mr. Kane.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
Yes?
You start tomorrow night.  Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken."  I'll get us some girls.  You get tickets.  A drama critic gets them free, you know.  Rector's at seven?
Take dictation -  Front page editorial -  "This afternoon a great man was assassinated.  He was the President of the United States -"
Yes?
Charlie!
There are the people of the United States, and they are blaming you - Oh, I know it doesn't make any sense, but at least you can learn a lesson from it.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
You're not going to like it in Chicago.  They wind comes howling in from the lake.  And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
I'll sign those papers -
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Rawlston is my boss.
Yes.
That must have been love.
Yes, sir.
Well, thanks a lot.
Millions - if anybody wants it.
Who told you you could sit down here?
What the hell is that?
It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man.
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Dick.
Why?
What, it's worse? You're pregnant with an Asian design major's child?
No.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
What?
You don't have anything to do with it.
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
He's not invited.
Yeah.
Well, he missed!
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
I've got a responsibility here. I can't let everybody grab free drinks.
The boss called. Arthur fell ill.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom?
Chess team Allan Harris?!
You know what I just watched?
All right, Vader's boss...
I guess.
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
It would stand to reason, yes.
You know what else I noticed in Jedi?
Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
Each egg has to be perfect.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Let's hear it.
You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store.
Which ones?
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Thirty-seven!
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
I know.
Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.
No argument here. Insubordination rules.
We're not playing in the street.
Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? 
After an exhausting game like that I can believe it.
Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning.
Jesus.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Oh, my god.
Can you imagine being halfway decent to the customers at least some of the time?
What?
Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.
Get to work.
I like to expand my horizons.
Living proof.
I'm not. She just left.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Leave me alone.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
Lovely story.
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
You were saying how you couldn't initiate change yourself, so I figured I'd help you out.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Do you work tomorrow?
Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How do you know that?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
It's not my store.
She's my girlfriend.
It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping.
Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work.  I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch.  You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too.
Be careful.
I'm trying.
And he got cancer by chewing fluorescent bulb glass...?
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
She called you, didn't she?
You're trusting.
Why do you say that?
Ooh! Can we?!
A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
Why'd you hit me?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
You've only had sex with three different people?
Who?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Thirty-seven. I just can't...
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
...it isn't there. Yes.
I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow.
Sure.
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
What're you talking about?
Randal...?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?
Can I have your name please?
What's this?
What are you talking about?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Did he say "making fuck?"
To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
You hope what feels good?
You'll be missed.
For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash.
How long you gonna be here?
I... I don't know what to say.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
You're not?
You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty!
Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos!
Says who?
That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds take it easy, all right?
Bye. 
Work!  Don't say that word, man.
Ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
Surprise me.
What usually eats a banana?
That was the first and last question-- now only answers. Where's the chopper?
It can't fly in this weather.
Copy.  Jessie, go to the top of Bitker ladder.
Where are you, Walker?
I'm coming out!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
Two...
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
I don't expect you to understand.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
Remember the first time we came up here?
What was God thinking when he built this place?
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Can you see light?
Pull it apart!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Gabe!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
Just kidding.
He never hurt anybody.
Tucker, you know where the money is-- I want it.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
I don't know about totally.
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Don't give him anything.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
You got what we need?
Appreciate it.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
I think Treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
Good evening.
Of course. Food alright?
No. She's dead!
Phoned some friends, sir?
Help you.
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you. Bell rings. Julian rises,
How do you do, sir?
Hullo.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
A cup of the old chai, sir?
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I swear it.
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.
Not feeling too bad now are you?
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Thank you, sir.
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, Alex, if I may call you, Alex?
Well, how are you then?
Well, still the same old place then, eh?
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just start. Please do. Alex retching.
Fair hair, sir.
Do you wear eye glasses or contact lenses?
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means anything?
Yes.
I was quite enjoying that.
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us. Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?
What?
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Big case?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
When was the last time you took one?
Max, the cab driver!
<u>Kill</u> you!  He's coming to kill you!
...he's two floors below you.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
No.
You know Dmitri?
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Federal?
You guys been holding hands?
And you came all the way down here to see me?
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
What's your name?
I came to see you, you look fine.  We gotta go.
How am I supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
You hassling my driver again?
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
Like what?
I'm not a hire car.  It's against regs?
You - you killed him?
With what?
What?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Are you breathing?
I didn't throw him, he fell.
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
I don't know any Rwandans.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
Guy with a routine goes and breaks it? Provokes attention.  That's bad.  And that's not good...
Fuck!  Nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  It's always been that way.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Who?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
Max?
That's love.
Why the hell not?
Mississippi?
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
Saved you last night's, too.
I don't see the connection.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
I can't promise you anything.
I think you're different.
What was your horse's name?
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
People do have heart attacks.
He says a dog bit his nose.
Crown Victoria.  F.B.I. car.  A legitimate tail.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Nothing is easy.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
More about life on Mars.  From a rock they <u>found</u> on the South Pole. Explain that one to me.  But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
So why are they after you?
Surprise me.
Equitation.
I've been reading up on it.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Never heard of him.
Has this happened to you before?
He's why you punish yourself.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  How it was possible.
We're going to Queens?
Liza?
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it?  Do you think it was your fault?  Is that why?
Did you kill my father?!
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
Liza?
How did you know?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I love you, too.
I'm a very patient man.
You made your decision yet?
And you feel bad for it?
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
So, you doing anything tonight?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
It makes perfect sense.  Field work is not our oeuvre.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
We have benzel activation, repeat, we have benzel activation.  Control to Arroway, you okay in there?  Repeat, Control to Arroway, come back.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Ellie...
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
Meaning...
The point is, this isn't just scientific inquiry anymore -- it's turned into some kind of personal obsession.
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator.  We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
Are you threatening me?
What is it?  What's happened?
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
I'm asking for your help, David.  I want to go.  They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist.  As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
What does it say?
How's the spying tonight, guys?
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Can you show me?
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
Many others.
You live here.
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
I didn't realize I was out.
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
It looks like pixie dust...  Kent would've given anything to see this.  David, too.
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
I think whoever sent the message did it because they're worried about us.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
Peter Valerian.
Any luck on the grant money?
But what about your research -- ?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
Jesus --
You sonofabitch.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Ellie -- are you okay?
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Some of my best friends are scientists.
I don't think so.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
Ellie... the last time we spoke... I said some things...
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm in love with you, Ellie.
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Gotta go, Arletta.
A salesman! Cool Hand Luke a salesman?
Yes, Boss. I got it right.
You cut that up fer lunch, Luke.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Here's the Patrol.
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
You can't do that!
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
Whatta you so happy about?
Shut your mouth 'bout my Lucille.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
You ol' sack of guts. I had a belly like yours, we wouldn't have nothin' to worry about.
Sure do... that's why we didn't bet with the Navy.
Foolin', Hell! I would have eaten that dirt for them. They coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... They just never did get a piece of my mind.
Luke, are you alright?... They got us, boy. They're out there thicker'n flies. Bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than I ever seen in my life. We don't have a chance, Luke... They caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, Luke. But I got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they wouldn't even whip you this time.
You don't understand a thing, do you, Drag?
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
Man Oh Man.
Back a buck.
One, two, three... 
I hate this...
Fear of what...
When was the last time you washed your hair?
I can't, Andy.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Yes.  Without question.
He was lying.
And you believed him when he told you he had done that.
Who are you?
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Where is it?
She's supposed to have it.
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Who was the man in the basement?
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
Is he out?
Sugar and cream for Goetz; I take mine black.  You're absolutely correct.  The politicians don't want panic headlines spoiling the Festival of Love.
He comes in the window, we maybe grab him.  Where's the on-switch?
Consistency is the hobgoblin of <u>little</u> minds.  Tell them to test for the chemicals found in Windex. That's a product for cleaning with...
Ah, if you knew that, you'd be half way to nailing him.  Serial killing is irrational and rigid and compulsive.  This guy has a plan all thought out, flexible and complex.  He's playing a game with us.  Who will he imitate next? Maybe he's doing all the serial killers in history, the great innovators, the murderers' hall of fame.  Just to prove he's better than all of them.  They got caught; he didn't.
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
What happened to you?!
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
I'm working on it!  It's what I do.  Quinn...Halloran.  I'll wait.  Where's Andy, can we get some coffee in here?
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
He hasn't done Bundy.  He's done every one of the others, hasn't he? If there are three dead Chi Omega college girls tomorrow, how will you feel?  Go there.  See if there could be any way for him to escape.
He's hacked into her Internet address.  He's a hacker.
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
Don't hang up!
Ma'am, please get out of your vehicle...
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Quinn will be here any minute.  What are you going to say?
I heard. Good police work.
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
She's blue as hell.  No marks on her neck.  Asphyxiated?  not the same -- no ligature marks.  Outdoors...
You messed with the scene.
There was no sperm.
I know.  Get out here.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Helen Hudson...
M.J., I'm going to have to borrow Ruben.  The alien-smuggling thing in Chinatown is going down tomorrow night and Jack's kid got hit by a car.  I gotta give Ruben to Nikko.
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
I'm gonna drop charges on the break-and-enter at Hudson's...
Detective Niccoletti?
Put in the Kevin Costner.
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
She doesn't lie!  You sure you fed her?
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
Poor darling.  What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
What!? They brought the car here?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
What about his wife? The woman doctor? Have you visited her yet?
It does.
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
There's still a patch of blood there on the road. Did you see it?
You're kidding.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
You could get your wish at any moment.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I'm the only doctor making rounds this morning.
I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
Just go ahead and tell us.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Please, Letty.
You know what, Ruthie? I better get back to my class, OK?
You look beautiful.
Go on, Letty. I want to see it on you.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
First off, Letty, can you tell me where you are?
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
We'll get caught.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
Furnished?
What do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Who ever said sanity was fun?
The restaurant, too?
When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
What?
I guess so.
Well then why'd it happen?
You don't have a fever.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
Sure. Why?
I think we need to talk about some things.
No.
You don't have to say anything else. I've known for a while that this was coming.
I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  Letty?
So will you?
It doesn't matter who.
I love him.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
You killed her!
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Who?
Where's your brother?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
Half the tapes.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
We can't.
In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
Besides, we don't know the city and--
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
You're sure?
Good idea.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
All right, knock it off.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Does it really matter what I say?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
Why haven't you turned us in?
Yeah?
We had a deal.
He told Enrique he didn't know anything about his car.
Hey boss, it's not a science.
Everything?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.
God, I want to go home.
Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and quite well known in France.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
You're not helping.
J&amp;B?
I can't even hear myself think.
No.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
What's this?
I don't care about your sword.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
On guard!
Why should I?  You need practice. I can teach you to fight with the Green Destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
What's it to you?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Hello.  What is your name?
Do you know her?
The handle is heavy.  And the blade is no ordinary metal.  Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
You're too young to understand.
It must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Where is he now?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Never!
Well, there used to be!  What's your name?  I'm Lo.  The Hans call me Dark Cloud.  I'm not that tall or big, but I'm quick as lightning.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
It has.  How's business?
What was it?
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
But Wudan does not accept women.
Don't you want to see her again.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master.  There is no antidote.
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
You've always been so good to Li Mu Bai and me.  Please accept our thanks.
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Don't thank me.
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
My name.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.
Mister Funboy.
I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
What the hell are you?
Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return.  No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing.
Don't waste my time.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
Nothing.
You promise not to say anything?
On my mother's life.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
I never said that.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
How about tonight?
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
Without question.
Okay.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
That's not fair.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
I'm sorry about that.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Those are my letters!
It was nothing.
I don't know.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
Okay.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
I don't know.
I did?
But -
Am I suppose to be this sore?
I like it better when I'm on top.
Need any company?
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
And this happened before you and I hooked up?
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
What are the terms?
Even there?
Fuck her yet?
What's wrong with you?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
Moving along quite well.
Who are you calling?
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Yippy.
Shut up.
Nothing.
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
I'm not in the mood.
I've never done this before.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
I know. She's so young and he's so -
Let me get that for you.
I'm paying you to give cello lessons. Not to pervert my child.
Got me off the streets? I live on 59th and Park.
Well please leave a message that I called.
She's out.
I said, do you want some water?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Mommy --
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
Irena.
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Yes, darling,
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Hello, Amy.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
Amy, not that old tree!
Amy, make a wish.  Wish real hard, and then blow out the candles, and your wish will come true.
Why didn't you run after them?
These are all from me.
Just you wait!
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Will you be friend for always?
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
You'll always play with me?
But you must!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
It stands so still.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
It got hit.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days — those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me — always!
I hate the storm. I hate it!
Yes...yes, that's true.
What is it, ma'am?
Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
What else is there?
How have you been feeling?
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Every woman at some point has to date a musician. I wish you'd get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
He hasn't said one word to me.
My date always pays more attention to you than to me.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to confession.
Holy shit, I don't know.
At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
What the fuck are we going to do?
Peter keeps asking me out.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
About Mark? Carlton?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I do development for TV movies.
You don't have to pee.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
So what book did you buy?
I've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. Must be wild.
I really gotta get going.
Was there anything in that washer?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
Frida. I was looking for you. You changing jobs?
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
Speaking of Mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch he fled the country.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
No, it's just... no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
Go away. I might hurt you.
I knew you wouldn't kill me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
He was found a few blocks away.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
What?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
It's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Says he is the man's doctor...  You know...
Please, they'll kill me...
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
What about Thompson, sir?  Wasnít this his case?
Sorry, sir.
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Good.
People...  after me.
Why are they after you?
Can't let you in...  sorry.
What?  Who has?
Someoneís after me.
Yes.
I cannot say...  You don't know the answer to that?
No, it's the truth.
How do I get there?  Tell me.
You understand what you'll be doing?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
No more than the usual.
You're kidding?
A month.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
I can't believe he'd do this.
... What?
Bob...
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Like how?
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
Hundredth cabinet meeting.  I thought it was a nice touch.
He's only doing what you told him to.
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
That'd be great.
No.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
I don't think so.
Gimme a quarter.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
`Dave'?
Does it make the cars any better?
Perceptual?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Dirty business we're in sometimes.
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
No.
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
What's wrong with a magic trick?
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
Where are you going?
That's a secret.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Well I guess...
Try to find someone who looks like me this time.  That last guy was a joke.
We're all set,  sir.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
It's some kind of....elevator. There must be something under the ground here....maybe....military.
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
Miss Henried, I think you better...
Sir. It's quite clear that...
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
The man I was with...until today... believed that praying was for blind men who couldn't see the truth.
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
I can find it myself. I didn't come that far.
They seem to be havin' a good time. Some punishment.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
They are brutes without feeling. Though I admit that I've requested cremation for myself. Burial is an archaic tradition, even more ridiculous now than it ever was. To say nothing of the...spacing problem...on a small island like this.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
So what the hell's Mutt been up to?
Well, I'd better find Patsy.  Say hello to Mutt for me.
You know how many demerits we're talking?
So don't goddam come!  Please.
The millions are awake enough for Physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  To be awake is to be alive.
At Chet Danburry's house.
What is the point?
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
But what if they see it, Nuwanda?
What?
Nuwanda?  Please?
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Who's in?
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
It's Nuwanda.
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?
What is that?
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
Good god, boy! Yell!
YAWP!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
I was just looking in an old annual and...
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
But father, it's not fair.
Father!
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
What?
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
That's a laugh.  If I don't ask, at least I won't be disobeying him.
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
How do we get out of here?
They are...they are everywhere.
Nobody's shooting nobody...come on, just let us through the hatch!
What the hell are you talking about?
And what? These things are octopusses?
Fok Yu and Fok Yu Two...are we strolling down memory lane for any particular reason?
Right here...middle of nowhere...and the answer to your question is yes.
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
And no questions asked.
Who asked any?
How soon can we get up and running?
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Did you clear this?
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?
So this boat of yours...that's what you do? Give people...rides.
Yeah you did...
The "come back" kind.
What's the matter?
Looking good...
Finnegan...
Let's just keep going.
...we gotta get outta here -- NOW.
I don't know...you got what we need?
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Second whistle you make it to the deck and get ready to jump...
Joey...
What the hell does that mean?
Nothing.
What is it man?
You want 'em?
That's mustard!
Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!
Who's going?
We're all going.
Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!
Who's full of shit?
You're full of shit!
They did not!
It's Nick!
I know, but...
Let's go!!!
Who? Who is?
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
Boy, do I love this conflict. Huh?... What the hell were you doin' in there?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Linda... Hey, Linda...
Sit with Linda, man, will ya?... Give her a beer.  Would you like a beer?
What kind of beer would you like?
Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
Mais certainment... A great deal of money. Naturally I do not do it myself. I myself do not possess the nerve.  But I am always... how do you say... looking out for those who do... It is a thing quite rare. Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't say no. When a man says no to champagne, he says no to life and that no man must ever do.  Where did you play?
Up north.
We... Three bullets.
You can do it, Sal.
No. No, no.
That way it sets.
You think we'll ever come back?
What else?
Merle...
We what?
More bullets in the gun... The trouble is that still leaves one of us with his hands tied up, so that means we gotta play each other.
How's Linda?
What's that noise?
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a week. Just to see Phantom Mary.
What the hell was that!  What did you think? Did you think it was loaded!
Up.
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You're working a partner on this.
You can't kill me.  I'm going to be Mayor tomorrow.
Remember my promise.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
You're crazy.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
See those guys?
They're going to rob that bank.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Can I ask you something?
You want to be a good detective?
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
What else did he get?
Rip Van Winkle.
I'm here.
Yeah.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
I just heard.
You should be in hospital.
I'm going to be a policeman.
You could always take it off.
Belle --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
You know that you're in my house.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Young man -- you got me there.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Mama!
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Oh -- you don't have to go to Miser Stevens while I'm around.
Sure am.
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
What Grange?
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
Now run along, Daniel.
Afraid ... of what?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
Good evening, Neighbor Stone.
Leave your tongue off of that!
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
No! No! No! Not him -- not my son -- I'd rather go with you -- right now.
What -- what's on your mind?
I'm sorry you can't see that, I know you could once -- you made a little speech once, that I'll always remember and I know the others do too --  They remember and they see how you have changed. That's why they didn't want to come tonight to you, Jabez -- you're as blind as a Burma bat, with your gold pot! Mind you, it's not the money, I've been talking about, it's what you make of it.
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Not long -- now.
There's nothing like it. I saw an inchworm take a drop of it once, and he stood right up on his hind legs and bit a bee. Come -- try a nip!
Headache -- Squire?
Well -- yes --
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
Mary -- it's gone.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez ...
I'll get the doctor.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
I'll get it, Jabez.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined. 
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Jabez! What kind of talk is that for the Sabbath? And me a-reading the holy word!
Now, Jabez Stone -- as for what you're calling hard luck -- well, we made New England out of it. That and codfish.
Well, son, I'm glad to see a Stone come up in the world again.
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
I want you to fix these fish!
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
With the presidential election coming up, I thought I could be of some help, sir.
Mr. Webster, I presume?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Let it be the quick or the dead -- So it is an American judge and an American jury!
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
Why don't you?
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
You're nosey, you know that, Argyle?
John.
How about his job?
Where are you going?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
Ellis...you shouldn't be doing this...
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
The code key, please...?
Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later...  ...I might get to someone you do care about.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
...the circuits that cannot be cut... are cut automatically in reponse to a terrorist incident...You ask for miracles, Theo...I give you the FBI...
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Oh...Where does he live?
They would, huh?
...I've missed you.						*
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
'Roy'.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
Roy?
Bullshit.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
We don't exactly know, Sir.  He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself!  You wouldn't believe it.
Yes, I would.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Hey, don't take the car!
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
I'm really shakey.
Yeah... I know.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I like that... yeah!
Oh... they're fucken crazy.  That's a snow job.  Don't listen to that shit!
Shit...
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah!
You try calling the police?
He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children.  His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. Unbelievable.  I wanted to get married ... He didn't really want it ... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things.
I'm afraid.
What a fuckin' comedy!  WNEW plays all the hits.
Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore?
You frisk me.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
What the hell you doin' back there?
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
I swear to God I had nothing to do with it ...
Okay, is the vault open?
I must of been outta my mind.
You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean?
What?
I stay here.  Damn it.  I just needed the insulin.  I'm used to it. Go on.  Go on.
What is it, Sam?
How did you know your son was involved?
No, not until after they killed him.
You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
You mean that?
I want him to think that.
Sonny -
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
It's the FBI.  He wants to come in.
I'm here.
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
Okay, when do I get them?
What's wrong?
I don't want him.
I can't allow that, Sonny...
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
Did Pop come down?
Why are you doing this?
Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids. I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week?
Wait a minute ... I'm talkin' to you.  I'm askin' you a question ...
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
<i>Well... I think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. I'm also a bail bondsman out of Los Angeles. I can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
Fella takes out two kids and has the audacity to not show up for trial.
<i>The children like to urinate in the balls.</i>
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
I don't know.
Yes.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
Take us to Vegas. <b> EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY </b> The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. <b> INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT </b> Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Hello?
Something is going down. Something bad.
What did he say about the arm?
Do you know where Danang is?
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
Ask Sal.
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
Squash it.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I hope the block is still standing.
Mookie.
Eddie, you're too smart for your own britches.  Listen to me.  How much do you want to run to the store for Da Mayor?
I'll see you out.
Nice!
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman.  You gotta lotta nerve.  Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do.  Come off it.
Tender-headed runs in my family. You tender-headed?
How are you holding up in this weather?
Twenty "D" Duracells.
I'll be back on my feet.  Soon enough.
ML?
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
We both do.
Quit bullshitting.
I can dig it.  It's gonna be HOT as a motherfucker.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.
Tina, what do you want me to do?
When?
Your memory is really getting bad.
To get my money.
Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Shut up.  The Boss!  Bruuucce!!!!
Keep dreaming.
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
That's what I think.
Pino, I work hard like everybody in here.
I understand.
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
I didn't want to come to work anyway.  I hate this freakin' place.
I should have Vito go with you all the time.
Vito!  Pino!  Let's go.
No, I'm not it.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Come over around seven.
Would you like something to drink?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
I go to school where I live.
I think it's just over there.
What?
Well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they're not in the cool crowd. Which I am, and you want to be. Know what I mean?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Exactly! A pirate!
Whoa. What was that?
HARRY.
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
...cause you said...
Come on, Lloyd. You must know someone I can talk to.
Sure I do. On one condition.
Do you want me to pet your head?
I bet you want your head scratched.
I know I did.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, it's Jessica.
Three words. I did. But you were all mad at me and wouldn't listen.
I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
What was it Jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
She wants us to show the world what a great guy Principal Collins is.
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Oh my god. Can you believe your ears?
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
She's one of a kind.
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
TURK, what are you doing here?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Sure.
LLOYD, may I see you a minute?
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Will that be on the midterm?
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
Anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a Special Needs class.
No. No. I heard from Superintendent ZIMMER this morning and evidently he's so impressed with our Special Needs class, he's bringing Richard MOFFIT himself to the Thanksgiving Day parade- check in hand.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
So the chest is still out there somewhere.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
This is horse?
The ring?... he was brought to us as is, Baron.  I...
What's that you're saying?
A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here within minutes!
Basically...
Would you really have drawn my blood?
Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us of.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Sayyadina.  Our Reverend Mother tells me she is too old... She has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  She asks that you pass within.
What does she fear?  What about my Father?
Will we see a worm?
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Why do they come?
What's in the box?
The Voice again.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
I have heard of it. -- REVEREND MOTHER It is very dangerous... very painful. The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... There is a place terrifying to us... to women. It is said a man will come... the Kwisatz Haderach... he will go where we cannot... Many men have tried...
You mustn't speak of...
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
The <u>women</u>?
Vampira!  You will come under my spell!  You will be my slave of love.
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
But, I don't like horses.  Do I have to get on one?
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
Bela, what happened?!
Is there anything I can get you? Water?  A blanket?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Bela, are you ready?
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
Eddie, you screwed up.
Out <u>there</u>?!  What happened to the stream?
Do you know I turned down "Frankenstein"?
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Don't you have any savings?
Eddie, I wanna make another picture. When are we gonna make another picture?
I don't know.  Where?
It's that easy?
What?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Better than not getting a job?
No!  He's very alive.  Well... sort of.  He's old, and frail -- but he's still Bela Lugosi!  And he's really nice.
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Mr. Wood?!
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
My eyes are killink me.
Excuse me, Sir...?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
Um, I guess --
I got married last night.
The marriage already ended.
I am.  How's your father?
I just picked them up on the way over...
No.  I'm from back east.  You know, All-American small town... everybody knew everybody, I was a Boy Scout, my dad worked for the post office...
Did you find it boring?
Let's get married.
Huh?!
Wow, this lab looks great.  Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Who?
What if--you're vomiting?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Come on...
Whatever happened to Norman Rockwell?
Al!
Yes!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
So?
You know what would be great?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
Okay, so you understand? We're installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
No, uh...
Yes, Ed.
You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
He's who we want to go with.
Yes?
Very quick. Between you and me, it's not a bad way to go. Making love to your wife... it's very sweet.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.
You know who we are?
You know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
She had white shoes.
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
What's the matter?!
Who?
But Al is your husband now!
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
I'm a tramp  Meet your new father. The whole nation is laughing at us!
Hi, Mom. 
Are you asking me?
I batted!
Oh God, this is so weird.
Oh yeah.
I wish my stepfather was here.
Why?
...if this ...  ... weren't here... ?
There's a list.
Come on, let's go.
This is going right up your ass.
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
Show business.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
Why do you do that?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Please!
Good-bye, brother!
Quite a shithole, isn't it?
Check forging.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
We don't have foibles.
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
What?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?
Thanks for everything.
Why are you lecturing me?
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium.  Be modest.  Thank them for this incredible honor.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Yeah.
Plenty of pep, too.
So Tracy?
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Jim, where the hell have you been?
And how did you get in the school?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
Fine.  Let's say all you ever knew was apples.  Apples, apples and more apples. You might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. Then one day there's an orange. And now you can make a decision. Do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? That's democracy.
Oh, no.  No.  I'm just finishing up here, and I've got to get home.
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Can I sign yours too?
Paul, get out!
You dumbshit!
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
We're looking for three colored guys who like to pop off shotguns. One of 'em owns a purple Merc coupe.
Can I get you a drink?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Are you sorry she's dead?
You use words like that, you might make me mad.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
I want to know about Exley.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
Yeah, I hate them.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Stens?  Was it Stens?
What's through here?
How's it going to look on your report?
Why?
I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Dudley.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
What do you want, <u>officer</u>?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Anything?
So on active duty, Meeks didn't make an arrest from 1938 to '43.
Say what and so what.
I don't own no shotguns.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Gone.  Not a trace.
No.
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
Why?
There always are.  But there are also three men and three guns. Matched forensically.  A few loose ends don't matter.
No... Where'd the tip come from?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
What are you talking about?
Bud White's been here?
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
How about White?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
It's okay.  These are police.  <u>What</u> do you want?
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.'
What's he doing here, Sid?
You tight with the D.A., trash?
How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish?
Where'd you hear that?
Around.
No, Sergeant.  I checked twice.
Yeah.  Sergeant Jack Vincennes requesting.  I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett.
Don't bullshit me, I can save your life.
I just gave him my card.
209 to anyone! I need some help here!
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Why?
It is?
I don't know who he is.
Considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, I'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.
Okay.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Yeah.
It's a SAT-tracker.
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
Jesus!
What'd I tell you?
You told me no calls.
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
I intercepted phone calls.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
They're here.
Gimme that.
We lost 'em.
Drive.
Goddammit--
What about newspapers and magazines?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
What are you saying?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
I yanked this off your RV. It's a Global Positioning Tracker.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
Yes. I have her permission.
Very good.
Well, I need to find out as much about Daniel as possible.
A report?
Than why can't you tell me.
Did he give you anything?
No.
Yeah.
No.
Well, you know--
I told you I didn't want you seeing her.
Oh, please--
Stacy, don't hang up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
This is science-fiction Robert! The manager showed me the transfer notice with your signature on it.
What happened to your head?
The lingerie.
It's really over?
Who?
Sir?
What can I do for you?
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
Do you like fish?
Eat your fish.
Good. You're just what I need right now.
This conversation's over.
--otherwise we may have to--
--otherwise we may have to--
Otherwise you may have to what?
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
Robert--
I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Mr. Dean--
She can't talk to you right now.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Who won the fight?
Did they take your clothes?
No.
Can I talk to you a second?
Rachel's dead?
Yes.
Why would they--
No, I--
Bobby? Piece of advice?
Yeah?
It's me, Robert Dean.  From Seth, Silverberg. I worked on--
I need help.
The police?
Yes sir.
The originals?
30 minutes ago you said we had him. What in hell's goin' on out there?
Dean's with Lyle.
Oh, let's assume that they have.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
How much did you pay?
I was concerned.  As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
As the wife of one of our party.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
You should come into the shelter.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Shall we be all right?
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Good.
No.
I can still taste you.
Arabic?
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
No.
Why did he bring you?
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Safe journey.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Shut-up!
Listen, Fritz, if I have to listen to another word from you I'll give you a fucking good hiding.
Okay.
David Caravaggio.
Petty thief, six months imprisonment Kingston Penitentiary, 1937.
Why is there so much nose?  I can't hear myself think!  Look - give me something.  So we can all get out of this room.  A name.  A code.  It's too hot.
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg in…have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
So was my Patient.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I liberated it.
Hello.
Oh, all over.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise.  The rest meant nothing to me.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
Marvelous plane.  Did you look?
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
Are you asleep?
Could I have a cigarette?
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
Is something funny?
I've met you before.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
It's what I've learned.
He can't even move.
Only we have to go to work.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
What's happening?  Am I needed?
This was your garden?
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Meaning--
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Motorcycle.
What about your bags?
You stole my luggage? You--
Nice spot.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Did I hear a car?
I didn't mean to get personal.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
You were afraid of heights?
One, two, three...
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
We're living history here.
Peoples China Bank.
And the money goes--
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
That was a lifetime ago.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
I cannot get rid of you.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
The key to success is using the right tools.
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
You two make quite a couple.
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
Erin Brockovich.  Car accident.  Not her fault, she says.  And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
What the hell is this doing here?
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Seventeen thousand in debt.  Whew.  Is your ex-husband helping out?
So.  You must've been feeling pretty desperate that afternoon.
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
The what?
Yeah.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
If you hadn't used profanity --
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
What are you doing here?
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
So you think we got 'em scared?
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
They skipped that step.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Really?  It makes me sick.
What?  Who?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Things like the head counsel for PG&E calling me with an offer.  20 million, plus attorney's fees.  Take it or leave it.
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Because <u>that's how people treat each other</u>!
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Uh-huh.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Hey, that's not so bad.  Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime.  So in legal terms, ten years is --
This isn't doctor's orders.  It's mine.  I'm saying you can't come.
Fuck Kurt.
How do you know that?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I don't know what you're talking about.
What kind of chromium is it?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
Masry & Vititoe, can I help you?
We'll see.
You always say that.  Then you go to work and forget you promised.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
How?
You're around every afternoon?
You're not nothing, Erin.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
Nothing.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
That's Ed.
About this.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Think you could learn?
I'm embarrassed.
Yes.  It's called accountability.
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
Next week.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
He'll learn.
I can help them!
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks and growls at his boss.
Barks at his master.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Our situation is most precarious. We have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
Whatever it is, it isn't friendly. I'm going to have a look.  Come on, Chewie.
We're doomed.  Goodbye, Mistress Leia.  Goodbye, Captain ...
Yes, Your Highness?
Does Luke know?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
We?
.... I'm afraid there's not much left.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Sure, they're safer.  You always know what they're going to do. Trouble is, it gets a little dull.
Where?
Those Star Destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  You can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
I see it Chewie, hang on.
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
A mining colony.
You look silly.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
I hope you make your peace with Jabba.
Why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am I glad to see you.
I always said you were a gentleman.
.... We are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the Empire.
What about Han?
What'd you say?
Someone's falling.
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
A tremor!
I have followed my feelings.
I thought I was in good shape.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
What's in there?
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Your future lies with us, Skywalker. Now you will embrace the dark side. Obi-wan knew this to be true.
The Hoth System?
Yes, My Lord.
Nobody's going to believe it.
Please
You were injected with glucose. There is no Plutoxin 7 virus. You were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
Where is he?
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
I was called away on urgent business, Snake.
See you in hell, Snake.
That's right, big shot. Unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.
So you want me to take her out?  Is that an order from the President?
Lock fuel rods.
Getting ready to invade.
The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.  Shall I begin evacuation?
Yeah, kinda.
They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.
What the hell is this?
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Run, Snake...They're coming.
I'm looking for somebody.
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
At last...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
He can be no other.
Merlin, help me. I need your help. I don't know how--
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
I must find the means to save him, then. I was hoping I could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...
Yes.
I'm going.
The laws, my laws, must bind everyone, high and low, or they are not laws at all. Lancelot will come...
I am wasting away and I cannot die. And I cannot live.
No.
Who?!
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
Very well. Climb up.
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
What's he doing there? Teaching?
I see, your excellency.
What did the doctor say?
Phonograph.
No, she was heavily sedated.
Good morning Madame.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
No. I'm building a new house, the old one's been sold. I was going to take Regan to Europe for a while, after she finished school here. Why d'you ask?
Yes am.
I mean, what if a person, let's say, was a criminal, like maybe a murderer or something, you know? If he came to you for help, would you have to turn him in?
Yes I could, I could see her as a psychiatrist...
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
What else?
No, is Regan aware of it?
Yes. He's already here.
Who's Captain Howdy?
Oh, Captain Howdy....
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?
Oh my god, you kidding, me marry Burke Dennings don't be silly, of course not.
Oh you did. What did you hear?
How do you know?
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
What are you doing here?
All done.
St. Mike's.
Yeah, don't stop. Keep going.
So what's next?
I'm not Regan.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
In here. With us.
No now.
Quod nomen mihi est?
How long are you planning to stay in Regan?
What's that?
Uoy era ohw.
I'm all right.
Is that too tight?
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
And let my cry come unto thee.
Shut up!!
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
That's to bad.
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
...Be gone!!
Yes.
Twelve.
I don't know.
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie.  You can't just --
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Twelve years.
Well, look at this.
You believe this?  The kid won't come out.  I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
They're falling out.
You the magician?
Oh my God ...
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
How we doing?
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
Fuck him.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
What d'ya got?
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
I don't gotta go.
Says who?
Frank?
What?
No?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
You, Frank.  All these years you been telling me we're different.  We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
All right, all right.  I'm a little tense.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
We do.  She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
He's drunk.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
What?
What the hell are these?
You're making things up, Frank.
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What channels it on?
You weren't there.
I didn't hear you come in.
No.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Yeah?
Sick?  How sick?
This is show business?
You're an hour and a half late.
When we know.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Nine!
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Virgins?
Great?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Some discussion.
Susie.  It's one more show.  One more time.  That's all.
Tom here tells me there's a problem with the pianos.  We were assured they were in tune.
Funny job.
Yeah.
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
Yes, well, it's probably best. No sense bringing someone else in.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
Forget it.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
How's egghead?
All I said was you were good.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
So, what happened?
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Coffee?
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
So how's the cat food business?
Vegetables.
Let me get the light.
Hey, what do you want to do?  Grow a beard?
How'd the show go?
Yeah?
None?
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Where am I?
How old is he?
A few blanks?  Like what?
... I was dreaming ...
No.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
You can't go.  You can't be anywhere near that place.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Now what?
What're you gonna do with me gone?  You'll drive your wife and kid nuts! I bet your daughter is just about ripe by now. What's her name, Janie?
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
What are you going to do, Castor?
They're too tight.
Pollux is -- what?
Screw your boundaries, Janie.  You have something I want.
You've got someone in your office.
You merciless bastard!
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
Done.  In fact, I was already plotting about the best way to meet the foreign bureau chiefs.
I'm not going anywhere.
You too?  This holiday's about giving, Adelle.  And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone...  Lifesaver?
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Her assistant?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
Hello?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Adelle?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Who did?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Big Ed’s.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
So could you write down her exact address?
So Jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
How’d you know my name?
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Do I look like I need your money.  It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
You can’t do this. You can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
I don’t think so, thank you...
Need a nurse?
I don’t care who you are.  It’s Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
She’s your dog, Jack.
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Hello!
Thanks, Jack...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Our life in a nutshell...
You mean this chocolate cake?
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
You really are incredible...
Worse, you mean...
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
I’m out of the doghouse?
You’re so...beautiful...
Think bigger.
You’re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
Kate...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
Of course I did.
I have to go to my parents' house out in Jersey.  Would you like to come?
That’s totally see through...
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
What?  Come on.  She's got a good thing with Victor --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
What is this?  Where's Reed?
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero who's been through a terrible orde--
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
So are you!
Stop it.
Look around, sis!  <u>She's not here</u>.  So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
And if he's not...?
Leonard, how's the feed?
Stable.  We're looking at low twenties.  It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
What are you doing here?
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
Are you kidding?
What are you doing?
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Why didn't you say something?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Sue, I need some of that anger, rage, frustration --
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
How bad off is he?
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Right, sir.
And take a little trip with them...
Trip? Where to?
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
A long time, with one man.
That's what they pay me for.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
That line was tampered with...
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Looks like somebody declared war.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Atomic fuel?
Then don't drift down further.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
...Is this a fucking joke?
Certainly -
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - I mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. It's like robbing Peter to play Paul, it doesn't make any -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Personal matters.
What the heck d'ya mean?
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Yah, but I'm sayin', that TruCoat, you don't get it and you get oxidization problems. It'll cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
We had us a deal here for nineteen- five. You sat there and darned if you didn't tell me you'd get this car, these options, WITHOUT THE SEALANT, for nineteen-five!
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
End a April.
Yah, he -
Where you girls from?
Well, the little guy, he was kinda funny-looking.
Yah, that can happen.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
No, I - they don't want - they're just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
You bet.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
...Yah, okay...
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Yeah, but -
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
...If it's so damned important to ya!
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. See, I gotta correlate that money with the cars it's being lent on.
Know who this is?
Well, what do ya mean?
Yah.
Good day, sir.
Yah, Shep Proudfoot said -
Yah, you bet. It's in the lot there. Brand-new burnt umber Ciera.
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, okay.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
You're darned tootin'!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Hiya, Lou.
...Well, that passed.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
How's it look, Marge?
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Uh-huh.
Yah, that's me.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Yah, if you're an engineer, yah, you could do a lot worse. Of course, it's not, uh, it's nothin' like your achievement.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
I'm sorry, Mike.
What'd he say?
Gustafson's accountant.
- looking.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
No, no.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
Is that your blood?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
I don't know if you're aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
What does that mean?
And I saw you practicing this...
A year?  How'd you manage that?
I want that.
Like testicular cancer?
Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.
No, thanks.
Here.
I don't know.
Tyler Durden!  Tyler Durden, you fucking freak.  What's going on?  I'm coming over there...
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
My suitcase was vibrating?
If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.  Marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
Tell the other person how you feel.
Being clever.
I don't follow...
Thank you.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
One-forty-eighth of a second.  That's how long it's up there.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Is it?
Same here.
Where's your car?
What?
You're sure?
You get rid of her.
Stop it.  This is your pain -- your burning hand.  It's right here.  Look at it.
Listen to me.  You have to consider the possibility that God doesn't like you, he never wanted you.  In all probability, He hates you.  This is not the worst thing that can happen...
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
I asked you what you studied.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
Should I E-mail you?  Should I put this on your "action item list?"
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Why do you think I blew up your condo?
This conversation...
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
What about them?  They're lunatics.
She's... you... you're fucking her.
Stop finishing...
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
Not exactly according to plan.
No more running off without you. From here on out, we do it together.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
You told me you'd say that, too.
It's free to all.
Biology, mostly.
It's not just about me.  Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident.  What if the others are in danger, too?
You were there?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
I've got to stop and help those people.
What's going on here?
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Want me to drive?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this...
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex.
"It?"
Can't you open the door?!
I don't.
You should have been next. After Lewton, you should've been next. That's the only pattern. You should be dead.
Fag.
Alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
What are you doing?
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?
You mean the snake?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
Show me how it operates.
You okay?
What do you call that?
I've seen worse places.
No cigarettes.
We'll check it out.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
She likes you.  Says you're dinky- dau.
What's that?
Snoring.  Five, six guys. Mumbling... Vietnamese.  Somebody talking in his sleep.  A toilet flushing.
American?
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Why's that?
It's nice there.  He's probably digging every minute.  Got a surfboard.  Breaking girls' hearts.
Thanks.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
We just take pictures?
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
What?
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
Colonel.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Will it hurt?
What?
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
My agent.  I called my agent.
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Uh... basement I think...
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
Yes well...  You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
How much?
You're a real honest to goodness <u>good</u> guy.
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
What?
Will you stand still so I can do this!
You advise us!
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
I never say anything I have to.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Twinky?
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
Give 'em the horn, Bob.
Well, id'n that nice.
If you're sayin' you're somethin' better'n what I am, that's one thing. But I can't say much a someone who'd run off an' leave a woman in a situation like this an' feel easy about it. An' that's all I gotta say.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Well, lemme play the other side then.
Serveza yourself!
Why'nt you take 'at sign off your tit, Ray, an' let's go on out.
You like it?
You're depressed that I come along.
No. How much do I owe you?
No substitutions.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
Tea.
No, I'm not...  I'm not.
I just can't look at you.
You know who it once belonged to?
No.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
Where's Catherine?!
I'm talking to you, Tita!
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Hello...
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
What kind of doggy is that?
And what about love?
No, I wouldn't.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
That's an old maid's tale.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
Yeah, it could be adorable...
Steam.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
Aaron, how you doin'?
Look at me.
God, I just wanna speak to you. I just wanna speak to you the way I feel about you.
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Oh you know, cleaned the house, cooked. Took care of my little sisters. Sit down. So where's Carlos?
I buy them flowers.
I did.
So what girls are over there?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
Eddie from Compost?
Which one?
I think by Twenty-two.
Umm, he got dark brownish eyes, he got a nice nose I love his nose. I love his skin. I love his lips, he got a great smile and he got-
Yeah, he got a bad attitude.
How old is he?
I think he's 18 or 17.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Hey!
Yeah.
Unbelievable.
He doesn't know? How come he doesn't know?
Sonofabitch.
Wonder who his supplier is.
Creasy, how old are you?
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Two bs?
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Where am I?
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
Are you serious?
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Has he?
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
That's Brazil.
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me.
Who?
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
Do you have a passport?
Not me.
Did you say cops?
Cute young thing, too.
I'm sorry?
Cute thing.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
You are a rich woman.
Uh... I'm just out of the shower.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think... What do you want?
I ordered lunch.
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
No.  I mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' I mean, ask me something else.
Yeah.
I decided I was going to tell my husband about you today.
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Muchas gracias.
Your call is come through.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
Moved out.
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Gummy and two cops...
Just give me a hint, all right?
Utah?
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
But I ain't got you...
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
No thanks.  I carry my own.
Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
Ah, the Dorothy Chandler.  I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
I'll do my best.
I'll buy you a new one.  I found her.
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
Hey, Don, how's the high blood pressure.
And it's good to see you, Julian. This is my assistant, Jazz.
What an interface!
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Why are all these people after me?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Let's watch some 'M.T.V.'
Are you okay?
Ick.
I got something serious to dis-cuss.
Ouch.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Two words.  Disco Express.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I want you to say that you're the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
Let me go out like a man.
It's 7:30.  You really should get a watch.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
Hi, private eye guy!
This isn't music!
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
'Bye, Johnny...
Man, I'm clean.
Calm down -- Henri!  You must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what I tell you.  It's worth more money to you.
Who's this --
Twelve o'clock... yes...
Everything's smooth.  Beautiful.  I will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Je peux l'ouvrir tout de suite?
Mais non, c'est pour toi.
Alain is the only man I know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
What's your story?
They'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
You want some eggs.
Yeah!
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Strike out, eh?
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
The guy's a frog -- I'm pretty sure. Also he made me.  Stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Why is it called Hellgate?
It was a crematorium.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You go to Xavier High School, Daryl?
Yeah.
Where's the collar, in the cells?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
Baltimore?
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Damn.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
Where's Johnny?
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
I love you, Bud.
I'm off.
Okay...
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'm serious.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.
What do you mean?
Uh, huh.
How's that?
Next time lets put some money on it.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
WB2YKXB, who've I got?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Sorry 'bout that.  So Queens, you psyched for the Series?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Dad...?
I think I'm losing you.
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
Why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
You all right?
Yeah, I think so...
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
C'mon, man.  Get inside.  I'll come over. We'll play some Nintendo.
Gordo?
You're not looking too good.
I'm sorry.  I just...you know...I...
What?
Got a minute?
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Fuck you, asshole.
Dammit Shelly!  Why do you always have to be such an asshole!
Look Shelly, you're my roommate and I like you... most of the time.  But you gotta stop doing these things.  Now, I set this date up for you, didn't I?  So don't embarrass me.  When you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
No more... I can't!
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
You're all just jealous.
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm going downstairs to get a beer. You want one?
It's dark down there.
Is that so bad?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
Shelly!  Where are you?!
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
You promised you'd never ask me.
My whole world.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Is that all you found?
He sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
Jason who?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
You mean you had a bad dream.
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
Where'd you get this?
I'm sure Cort and Sissy are back in their cabins.  So you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
Boy scouting.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes!
I gotta show you Jason's grave.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
No, I --
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
Get up!
Does he know about what happened?
Oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
Yeah...
About what?
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Never.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I mean really never.
Steven!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
A major prick.
What murders?
I thought I told you to stay away from her.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Yes...
Rennie...??
I never left the garage without my Windex.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
But didn't we know it would happen?
Asbestos lining.
We must abandon.
What do I exude?
It's just a review.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
He'll hate it.
`The most interesting thing about Elliot Litvak is that he writes the way he looks -- fuzzy, grubby and shifty-eyed.'  I'm telling you as a friend.
The American theater doesn't need people like that.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
How do you Eknow.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
Look. All I want is a haircut. I'm not worried about this guy.
What?
Do you want to get some coffee?
Is it?
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
Even if the truth about a person is sad or depressing or shocking?
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
What else?
See, Daddy.
Two-all after six.
All right. What's been going on?
Who the hell cares?
Joanne Bourne.
What's it like to shoot somebody?
It's Stanley. It's the Steamer. Fate has spoken to this man in the depths of the night.
Where the hell are you?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Everybody else does. Why not you?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
How come you got the kid with you?
It's the kid's lucky day.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
You're charming the boy.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Don't worry. It's a test.
They're my team.
I was six years old the day Pesky hesitated throwing home and Slaughter scored all the way from first. That's when I knew the Red Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
I had lunch with Joanna. She said she told you about Peter. You weren't concerned, she said.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
Yessiree, Bob.
Finally, I get a waiter who doesn't know "Macbeth".
I kissed her while she was laughing.
This could be it.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
I don't know.
No one's waiting.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
Are you sure?
God gave you ten thumbs.
I thought you were a man of God.
What are you doing?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
You're an ambitious man.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
In England, I was a poor student but I --
Well, then, it must be fought. We are children of God like everyone else.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Bapu, for me, and the rest,  if that is what you want, we will accept it. But out there  already there is rioting because Hindus fear you are going to give too much away.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
You didn't beat me that day.  I beat <i>myself</i>.
Grudges?
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Something's not right.
No, we've missed something.  We Hoover again.
How often do you test, Director?
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
What's wrong with him?
Leave?  Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving.  I see it as going home.
The Mission Director.
Where?
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Where are you going?
First, we may as well decide on gender. Have you given it any thought?

Not that.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene?  What about <i>you?</i>  Where were you last night?
Why would we do that?
You didn't know?
What <i>is</i> this place?
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your--  --nose.  How perfect does your child have to be?
You gotta be kidding.
I get my own help.
Where did you get those?
I've been doing my homework.
Better than old times.
How's Estelle?
You go out much?
I guess I'm kind of...
How was it?
I couldn't have... much longer.
Promise you won't laugh.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
There are three men dead.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Yeah.
When I got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
He must have.
Your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in Huntsville.
I'll bet you can.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
Sounds good.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Come on, come on.
I don't know, airport I guess.
Yeah, why not? We're the good guys.
No, I'm afraid not.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Yeah. I got out.
Just fine.
How long have you been married?
What's the damage?
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
When did you find out?
This is my brother's car.
Well, he drove it into the river.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
How'd it happen, then?
What about?
Kinnear. Cyril Kinnear.  Kinnear did it.
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Jack?
Who paid you to see me off?
Everyhing go off all right?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
How'd you know where I'd be?
What kind of entertaining?
You've been watching the film.
Shouldn't think so.
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Let her go. She'll be OK.  Sorry about that.
How's school?
Working at Woolworths.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
Did you work with him, Keith?
I mean, what for?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Are you a traveller?
I'll call the police.
You're a bastard.
No.
What, and get myself beaten up again?
No chance of that.
No. I'm visiting relatives.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
Eric told me of your bereavement.
I have to. Things to see to.
You're bluffing, you bastard!
What's that? A hundred?
All right. Two hundred.
You're not seeing me?
Polacks and deadbeats.
Deadbeats all.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
You ever get 'em?
They did.
It's too...
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Eh...?
...that's right...
No.  That's absolutely right.
...that's right...
Yes.
Who?
With River Oaks?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
What hard part?
Just the act.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
Huh.
They...
When they...
What?
Somebody...
Should do something to them.
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
For five thousand?
Is that what I said?
Yes.  It is, George.  Yes.  It's a big decision.  And it's a big reward.  It's a big reward.  For one night's work.  But it's got to be tonight.
What?
You're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
That's right.
You went for it.
It's a waste of time.
...what am I going to do all month...
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.
A waste of time?  Why?
Where were you?
No, who?
Will you excuse us please?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
I meet gestapo tactics...I meet gestapo tactics...That's not right... No man has the right to..."Call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  That's not...as long as I've...
Levene!
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
Roma, would you, I'd like to get some lunch...
Could I...
...you didn't close...
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
The leads are assigned randomly...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Alright.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
That's alright.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
You are?
What are you trying to tell me?
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
You're so full of shit.
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
I've got the check...
The check's no good?
Give me some leads.  I'm going out... I'm getting out of...
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
When?
"Always be closing..."
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Or a piss...?  A great meal fades in reflection.  Everything else gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's only food.  This shit we eat, it keeps us going.  But it's only food. The great fucks that you may have had.  What do you remember about them?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
No, I'm saying you don't include Saturday...in your three days. It's not a business day.
I don't know.
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
She told me I have to.
The deal.
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
I'm going home.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
I have the stuff from last year's...
Three.
Yes.
Will you take me?
Why do you have to go?
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
How are the kids?
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
I don't want to stay here...
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
I never met them.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Sincere.  What are you talking about, of course I'm sincere with you, Mike.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
What do you want me to do?
I've always taken care of you.
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
Beautiful.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
Mikey, I hoped...
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
That plane goes to Miami...
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned.
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
This committee owes an apology!
Kay.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Right here.
You're a great man, Mr. Roth, I have much to learn from you.
We do favors for each other...
Enjoy.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed?
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
I deny his every charge.
You were unfair with them.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
I thought we would meet alone.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
We got no choice.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
Fuck you.
This looks corny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
Oh, I don't know.  Because no girl in her right mind will have me?
You did not know?
Well...no, not really --
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
What do I do?
Mornin'.
Or would you prefer a beer?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Still.  You must be rich.  Making a couple of famous movies like those.
What did she mean by going flooey?
You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head.
You mean, like posed for pictures?
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
Take a picture, it lasts longer.
Is this David's doing?
I liked it.  We all did.
No.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Did you kill anyone?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Can't today.
Does that surprise you?
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Why not?
What happened?
Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
You're the one who started it.
No harm done.
I'm game.  Sure.
What was that about?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
It's not like her.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing?
Never gave it much thought.
-- that I was a Marine.  Which is true.  You filled in the rest.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
What won't do?
Did I hurt you?
Fuck off!
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
Mr. Kay, sir.
Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures?
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
You're serious.
Okay.  "Frankenstein."  Tell me everything.
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
My monsters?
How are you?
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
How's Atley -- ?
What are you still doing here, Randall?
okay ...
Yeah.
What's the matter?
Donny --
How's it going -- ?
Jesus. The whole damn thing's loaded.
You look good...
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
You getting my checks ... ?
It's ear-marked for Mirror Man and The Sphinx...
Sure -
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Kip -- ?
Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
About what?
You?
What are you doing here?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Ain't we good-timing here ... ?
Price of doing business...
What?
You remember where you got this Eleanor -- ?
Hospital.
Take it back, Freb --
So I was replaced by Mitch?
Yes. But I got a feeling it's not on account of any longing-for-my-touch on your part -
And you got some Italians -- ?
Six or seven...
What the hell are you doing -- ?
That what you want?
We were good when you bailed, weren't we?
Very good...
Let me worry about The Club ...
No worries ...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
Okay, then... Otto?
How old are you now, Toby?
Okay. All our ladies should be home now, tucked in bed. Let's keep chilly. Think Slow. Any questions?
Why don't you leave him alone?
Look at Jeannie's kid.
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Anybody!  You understand?
Talk? To you? After what you did!
What do you do?
What are you gonna do?
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
You know. The stuff I left.
You what?
I got seared.
Keep 'em coming.
He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing. In the old days, Jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  On the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. We were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but I had a feeling Jimmy was trying to sense whether I was going to rat him out to save my neck.
I can't make any more deliveries.
Yeah.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
He's got your father upset. Good thing he doesn't have to go to work in the morning. Is this what he deserves?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Yeah.
Submit, bitch! Submit! Submit!
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
She went to Medical school in California.
How you doin'?
Oh, right.
How much money you got?
Did your Uncle get arrested?
I don't think I...Larry?
Will you take a check?
What class did you say that was?
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
And what do you see?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
What're you doing?
Fuck do you want?
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
This rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. One edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. Can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
Of course.
Oh, come on! You're not pinnin' this one on me. He left, I wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. I was havin' fun.
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
What do you mean "he didn't talk?" You sat there for an hour?
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
What problems does he have, Sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
--And who do you think he's handling? He pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. And for 20 years he's been alone because of that. And if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. And I'm not going to let that happen to him!
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Why there?
I got one of those too.
Sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
What did you think?
Poor color composition, lousy use of space. But that shit doesn't really concern me.
What is?
Why thank you.
Haven't called her.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
My wife's dead.
Why not?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
What?
They're all dead.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
Which one did you take, Will?
Good for you. Congratulations.
I'll keep in touch.
No. Thank you.
I'm Will.
I didn't mean you. Listen, maybe...
Yeah?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No.
Oh, you will?
How was that?
Yeah.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey, Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny, and Brian.
Where have you been?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
How the hell did you do that?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Will? Are you awake?
I know. I just do.
Yeah, I'm sure.
--Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
Will ya look at her!
But ain't no reason--
You're *ticklin' me!*
Any gas?
What's it to you?
Two.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
They never wrote you nothing?
I ain't no preacher anymore.
Casy! What you doin' here?
Thought you was in jail.
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
They won't. They're a-gettin' five an' they don't care about nothin' else.
No, but--but you seen that advertisement in the Spicy Western Story magazine. Don't pay nothin'. Jus' send 'em the coupon an' you're a radio expert--nice clean work.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Lookin' for a job?
You been acrost?
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
*Ain't* a-goin'... ain't a-goin'...
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Where you think you're going?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
An' you won't let nobody touch me?
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
She shore don't look prosperous. Want to go somewheres else?
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
Got any more, Ma?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
That Casy. He might a been a preacher, but--he seen a lot a things clear. He was like a lantern--he helped mw see things too.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I know, ma'am... on'y it's for a ole lady, no teeth, gotta sof'n it with water so she can chew it, an' she's hongry.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Think I'll walk out an' try to fin' out what all that fuss outside the gate was. Anybody wanta come with me?
Cut it out, Pa. He'p Al with the truck.  Don't fret, honey. You goin' to be awright.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
You people looking for work?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Wonderful.
So, what are you doing now?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
What am I gonna do?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
What's your business?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
Bad people.
Yes.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Which would you rather...?
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
What if I come back?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
How do you know?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
No.
Thank you, no.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
It was the PLO.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
Enough?
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
To shoot you. Correct.
How did you get this job?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
A jogger, huh?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Why didn't it work out?
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Annie!
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Fine!
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Fine!
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Then why do you want to leave?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
You already did.
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Started what?
Let's bring your bags inside.
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
That bag's almost empty.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
How was the dinner?
Why did you go?
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You've already made arrangements!?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
She will if you think she should.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
Good night.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Yeah, what?
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
I'll have another round of that spaghetti if may?
What was it like?
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
You don't seem to upset?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Annie, it's Liz. How's Grace?
I wouldn't let happen.
Can you drive?
Cool?
She's rabid, but cute.
What's that?
Oh yeah? What's that?
Shh!
Hold on a second!
...and your name goes through like seventeen computers a day. 1984, yeah right man, that's a typo. Orwell's here and now, he's living large. We have no names, man, no names. We are nameless. Can I score a fry? Thanks.
What are you, stoned or stupid? You don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the FBI. Where are your brains, in your ass? Don't you know anything?
His parents missed Woodstock and he's been making up for it since. Hey, you hear about Joey's bust?
You heard of a hacker called Acid Burn? You know who he is?
Did you talk to him?
Dead?
I'm taking over a TV network.
Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
I told you, I don't play well with others.
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
That's Razor and Blade.
They'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
Fucked if I care, man.
Here's your class.
That's a nice score for a girl.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Uh, hold on...
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
Why did he come to you?
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
I can't believe they decided you won.
You know, I've been having these really weird..
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
Alright. How about the Master of Disaster, huh?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hello?
Hey, it's me.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
What?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
Hello, operator? I'm having trouble dialing a number.
Just one moment.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
Brady!
Mom, please
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Sure it does.
It's been eleven months.
I wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Come on Rachel!
I thought you said you were ready.
Rachel come on.
Call me.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
You look sharp. You understand?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
He's been here.
It's over.
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Okay.
Jamie! Get away!
Hi, Dad. What happened?
You're going to be late!
It's been totally charted.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
What's this big, big news?
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'm glad you're here because I have something I want you to do. I want you to call up Ben Tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
Deal. Hey, I thought Paul was grounded.
Annie, Paul's on the phone!
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Will you call me tomorrow?
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
I think you have too much to do tomorrow.
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Well, she's totally not here.
Yes, I am.
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there. Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house. He said real awful stuff happened there once.
I don't like that story.
After the movie.
There was no one outside.
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
Tommy, stop it! You're scaring Lindsey.
What is it, Laurie?
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
Hello.
Yes, she is.
Thorazin.
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
Yeah.
That's disgusting!
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
Right.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Yes.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
Could you--
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive.  This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
She has all the cooking talent.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Get his wine away.
Who thinks about such nonsense? Now I'm alive.  When I'm dead, I'll be dead.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
Why?
Tch, oh.  I always told you you would leave me.  But...does it have to be now?
No.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
Jesus...Jesus!
Oh...
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Come on.
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Really?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
Oh!
...you know?  I, uh...
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Perfect!
Frederick didn't come with her.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Singing?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Ohh!
I know, no--  I know.
Hey, hi!
Awwww...
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Yeah.  Me, too.
I'm okay.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Nobody ever said it.
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Oh, well.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, wow!
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
You're afraid of dying? MICKEY  Well...yeah, naturally.  Aren't you? I-- L-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would I come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
I have not read you your rights.
...how are things at the Hospital?
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Who would that be.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
How was America?
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
You spend the afternoon in Bed?
What do you want me to do?
The children...?
I won't take much of his time.
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
...here's to child abuse!
I can make you rich.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
This just came in, over the transom. Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina.  Look here:
A fellow with five fingers.
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
I'm an orphan.
What'd you say, hon...?
Give it up, Evelda.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
Why should <u>you</u> care?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
The girl needs help.
...might I make a suggestion...?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
You goin to shoot yourself? 
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
...what did you want? 
The great and <u>beautiful</u>...
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I don't <u>think</u> so.
It is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...sir...?
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Thanks, Talia...Why are you so nice to me?
Go stand by the flagpole.
No, they're not from Wendy.
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Am-ber!  Uh...don't do that.
Who wants to go tell the Anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
I think your passion is terrific.
Do you really not believe in God?
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
Do you really think we're fooling anyone?
Have you ever thought of instead                            ] of making children more equipped                            ] for reality, we should make reality                         ] more equipped for children?                                 ]
I'm sorry? I don't get it.
You don't have anything <u>for</u> her either. Come on, it'll be Very. The note'll give her shower nozzle masturbation material for weeks.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Heather? Wha...
Ku-urt, let's pa-arty.
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
No.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
I've been moved around all my life; Dallas, Baton Rouge, Vegas, Sherwood Ohio, there's always a 7-11. Any town, any time, I can pop a Ham and Cheese in the microwave and feast on a Big Wheel. Keeps me sane.
That was my first game of Strip Croquet, you know. I thank you.
Killing her won't solve anything.
Good plan.
"You might think what I've done is shocking..."
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
We've got a Playgirl, a candy dish, a Joan Crawford post card, and lipstick.
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
I did not want them <u>dead</u>.
You know what I want, babe?
I thought I...you..
Who does that new kid think he is with that coat? Bo Diddley?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
I'm lost. You don't get enough attention, you get too much attention. Which is it? Where are your shoes?
The world wants winners, I guess. Not people stained with loserness.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
Bye.
Hello!
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
hurries over.
Fruit.
It doesn't matter.
What??
John has fallen in love with me!
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
It's inside a moving car.
Second most common?
Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things.
GWEN?
I said she's been missing for-
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
What's wrong, Trev?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Morgue...?
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Last week...
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Nah, I fucked it up.  I was tryin' to impress this kid, don't ask me why.  I was gonna rescue his old man, but I couldn't find the poor bastard.  He musta blew up.  I got the hell outta there.  I didn't have the nerve to face the kid.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
I'm not saying I hate sick people or anything but I hate being <u>around</u> them if you know what I mean.  There <u>you</u> go, you <u>inspire</u> this kid to <u>live</u>.  I probably woulda vomited on him.
Bernie.  Call me Bernie.
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Mister LaPlante...
Nope.  Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
Bill, I...
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way.  Let's go, Chucky.  A police escort is gonna pick us up en route.  You too, LaPlante.
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled.  Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail.  You won't get a cent.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh?  He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
Yeah, my dad's great.  He took me to the zoo.
Uh, no.
Uh, er... I...
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Vietnam!
Gale!  This is for you.  I want you to know I never meant to hurt you. This will explain everything.
"A little mistake"!
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Helluva story!
He lost a shoe!
You didn't?
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
They're great with kids.  They love 'em.  They eat 'em up.  I'm kidding.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
-- a sense of proportion.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
Right.
Well, these are good signs -- she's broken up with him and the two of you seem to be developing quite a rapport.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Oh, great.
Do you do washing machines, too?
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
About us.
I'm thirsty.
Why are you mad at each other?
Did Daddy tease you?
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
Mommy!
Rita, he's only twelve years old,
He doesn't have a temperature.
Honey --
Neil, calm down.
What?
But it's what we want.
You want me to bargain at the high end of our range?  -- I'll have a stroke.  I've got to save all my sweat for my meeting in three weeks.
And it's a shorter commute.
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Where should I hide the car keys?
Should I come home when I'm finished there?
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
What about cable?
Why?  I just read your report card.  What's the point?  Stay home, watch some television, we'll get "Mad" magazine delivered.  What kind of report card do you call this?!
I have a cold.
What did the thermometer say?
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?
No joke, Lieutenant.
Y'know, the guys in robbery are gonna get kind of upset.  We're stepping on their toes of this one.
He had to come from somewhere.
A few days ago.
Around.
No -- it isn't.  A cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  I want some answers, Nash.
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
That's all?
I'm leaving.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
Living.  Remember?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
You guys are from the British museum, right?
A lucky guess.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Where did you get it?
I'll be fine.
Because it's my name.
You're twenty minutes late.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
Yes -- it is.
No.
If they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
I've seen it.
We found him this morning.
I was working on the cataloging.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
How can that be?
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?
You get anything on Smith?
Bullshit!
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Jesus.  What is this?
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
It's over now, Dennis!  Don't hurt anyone.
I'll give you these people.
We been through that.  Forget it.
You'll cap my ass as soon as I step out the door!
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
It's a safety room.  If anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Donuts here any good?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
What hospital?
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Are civilians inside?
Just one question.  Please.
I'm Jeff Talley, the Bristo chief of police.  So far as we know, your children are okay.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
I'm Talley.  Who's in charge?
Sounds like you know the job.
He says that his father's hurt.
We've got to get those kids out of there!
We're okay.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I've got the boy on the phone.  He's using a cell phone.  What was that, son?  I didn't hear you.
Is my daddy okay?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Your dad has two computer disks.  They have funny names:  Marlon and Al.
Can you open them?
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Did you find the disks?
Yes.
I can't control what happens.  The Sheriffs are running the scene.
Your phony FBI assholes.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
Paul!
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
Congratulations. You should spit in my face.
Will you protect us.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
I'll be over.
No.
I am going to do you a great favor.  I am going to take you with us to Gitarama.
How so.
You lie.
We’re not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. That's the ground rules.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
When will they be here?
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Are you sure this is the river road?
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
That will take time.
Call, sir?
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Thomas wants advice?
Oh, my God!
What is it, Paul.
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
We are almost out of water.
That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
You have taken business class?
Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.
Thank you, sir.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
So what stopped her?
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
Looks like we're it.
Just for the record: what are the rest of your names?
You said that was an accident.
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Pritchett!
Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
An answer, I hope: exactly what -- or who -- Melissa was taping.
You hear somebody?
We can do it...
It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
Don't think it's even an issue.
Run.
You okay?
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
Could we have a word?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
Really? Well, let it rip.
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- wit...nesses --
You think this is fucking funny??
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
Please! Something! Oh-God!
I think...I may have the answer.
Good way to get your head blown off.
What is it??
Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
Houston, I think we may have a problem.
This? This is nothing. You've only been dealing with the House itself. You have no idea what you're tinkering with. Sooner or later, the darkness that is at the core will get out... One of you will release it... Not meaning to, of course... then...  ...Bye, bye, Miss American Pie...
He must've unsealed the room!
Something....happened --
They don't build them like this anymore.
What will they tell you?
By freeing them.
Are we leaving mommy?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
What about all my other stuff?
Where is she?
Sure.  Did you see the others?
He's blessing the house.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  The videotape...
Whoa there...
You don't think I know?
Are you all right?
My name is Father Seamus.  I'm from Holy Rood church.
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.
What...amulet?
The rain is letting up.
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
The war pulled poetry out of some of us. Others it affected differently.  This is me a few years later.  We're in India, by the way, and it's 1921.  I was like many survivors. Lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. We'd seen God fail, you see.  So many dead.  For us God, too, fell at Flanders.  We adjusted to the loss.  And if we mourned, we mourned in silence. Thousands drank themselves to death. Others went further.  I went further.  I thought I was a lost soul.  But, until this frozen moment, I didn't even know what the phrase meant.
Kirsty Cotton.  Yes.  But ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
No.  I'd seen him in there a few times before.  He was just a punk.  I'd never like danced with him or anything. Anyway, he was a thief.  He must've taken it from the statue.
I figured I'd make breakfast.
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
I don't know his name ...  I saw the whole story.  A wounded bird was on his roof.  I could hear its cries from here. He went straight to it.  I couldn't've. I'd be frozen between pity and fear. But he wasn't.  Its pain spoke directly to him.  He picked it up.  Nursed it. Fed it.  And it got better.  Everyday he'd watch the pigeon.  Everyday the pigeon would watch him. I saw him learn. Learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. And one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  Didn't look back.  But he heard the sound of its wings.
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Can we see?
Yes really.
Good.  So did I.  And that's all ...
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Good ... Good ... Look, why don't you come over?  You know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  Just see how we both feel?
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
Yeah right.  Look ...
No.  It isn't ... she wouldn't ... It's like I must have done something wrong, you know?  Freaked her out.  Just fucked up something good again.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
I didn't know how to tell you.  A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night.  Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month."  Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
"You could be swinging on a star."
Did I miss anything?
Count of three?
Welcome back to Vinci.
You're unemployed, Alfie.  Boss is dead.  Her plan is over.
Don't you just hate kids...
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Yes.
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
You know Kaplan, if you weren't the slimiest pinata of shit that ever lived, I'd feel sorry for you.
Something short.
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Well, that even surprised ole Moses at fust. I didn't think the Board was that smart.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
...The people look like ants.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Norville!
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Watch it, Archer --
You can't print that!
Whatever! It's no dig on you, Archer, but this story is hot and you're no longer on top of it. Why, it's the scoop of the century -- the other papers won't have the Gunderson dope 'til tomorrow -- The Allemeinischer Zeitung, Le Figaro, they'll be choking on our dust come mornin' --
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Anyway. Any particular reason you didn't give him my Blue Letter? I mean, Jesus, Norman, just a dying man's last words and wishes, no big deal.
Oh, geez.
...Yeah, go ahead.
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
Damnit, where's my car!
Ya get the special?
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
At the Houmfort.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
I'd love to.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
Mrs. Rand.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
You're single?
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
As a matter of fact, it means the sugar syrup is ready to be poured off.  You'll have to excuse me.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
Bring me another, Ti-Joseph.  I have to keep the lady entertained.
I don't know.  I once asked Dr. Maxwell the same question.  He said he thought she was like a sleepwalker who would never waken.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Good morning, Miss Connell.
I heard about your little misadventure yesterday, Miss Connell.  On your first "day off," too.
How do you know I'm not?  I was cruel to Jessica.  When I got to know her -- when I found out how empty and ungenerous she was, there was something about her -- something smooth and false -- that made we want to hurt her.
Don't, Paul -- don't doubt yourself -- don't make me doubt you.
I want you to be safe, Betsy.  I want to know you're away from this place -- home again, where nothing can harm you -- nothing and no one.
You want that?
No -- it's about Mrs. Holland.  A result of our discussion the other day, I'm afraid.
Of the nature of Mrs. Holland's illness.  And, of course, the events which led up to it.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
Why?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our...
You want to go?
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
In the car.
Damn it, Ben --
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Ready to go?
I'll drive you --
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Anyone special? You know...
Sure dad.
Ben--
Here.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
A prior engagement overcame me.
How you take it isn't all that interesting to me, Benjamin. I'm sorry --
Nah.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
-- What advice? You never --
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Hi mom.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
Forget what?
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
Waste not Master Hood -- that was $20 for the bag.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Do what?
Check it out. Not for the faint of heart.
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
It's freezing.
You're parents at that party?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Hey Wendy.
Nice kid.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
I could say the same thing about you.
How much closer would you say you were?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
We're sure it's hers?
How do you mean?
What do you want to talk about?
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
Well, I gotta tell you.  With a wife, three kids, and a pension plan in the balance, it's rattling hard.
One word to I.A. and he walks.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
Your friend's all business.
You heard me that time.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
I don't know.
You don't know.
You and Kay were like sisters?
She was only seventeen.
Couldn't get it up, Walter?
I have not spoken to him...
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
She is.
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
I couldn't prevent it.
You held sway over them. They feared you. You wanted it to happen.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
I want more.
You want me to be a doll forever?
We're immortal. You've always known that.
Don't mock, Claudia...
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
It can't be -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
You know her?
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
She is dying. It happened to you too, but your child's mind can't remember.
But if she dies...
Bear me no ill will, my love. We are now even.
Then my luck would have changed.
You want death? Is it death you want?
How do you mean, start?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
You really want to be with them?
It can't be...
As did the one who made me.
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Where are we?
What, no flowery speeches? About what a monster I am? What a vulgar fiend?
Lestat!
Claudia, Claudia, will you never learn? Who will we get now to finish your dress? A little practicality, cherie...
Claudia! Don't do this thing!!!
No... You come back to me Louis...
That's all past, Lestat.
You believe this, don't you? That you're a vampire? You really think...
How did you do that?
Nonsense, my friend. I can look on anything I like. And I am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
Can a vampire feel love?
You loved your wife, surely.
But you talk about passion, about longing, about things I'll never know in my life! It's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! And then you tell me it ends like that? Just empty?
You promise to care for her then?
Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
Then I'll call the mainland for a charter.
Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out.
I thought you were out of town!
What are you doing in my closet?
That was heart attack time, Karla.
There's nothing between Will and me.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Hello? Hello?
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.
I know I don't want to stay in here.
No, you're not.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
I'm fine.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
There was a body! I swear it!
I don't think so. It's pretty crowded.
Something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Okay, I just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
I'll come with you.
Come on, it'll be fun.
How'd you like to win a Magic 96.7 Quicky Getaway?
You guys lost?
Not anymore.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
Where is Miss Wollsten?
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
Has that girl -- has Thea ever told you where she comes from?
I felt he did not like me.
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
That your father and I ——
Really, this is idiotic!
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
She is not there. The coffin is gone.
I can't understand that.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
Get that ladder up here.
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves. Come on out here, both of you.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
You have no car.
Made what?
A boy?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
I want the Board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. Good luck to you at school, George.
Thanks.
Hey, Ernie!
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
When'd you see him last?
It will?
Zuzu –– Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
What's that?
Oh –– Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
Aw, forget it.
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
I know it's soon to talk about it.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Say, where's Mother?
Nothing.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
All of it?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Well, what about all your other friends?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
How's that?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Where's your coat and hat?
My hair's getting wet!
Oh, shit.
Is she responsible for the punch?
Turkeys!  Eat wind!
Putz -- that won't be for hours.
They're okay, if they got little white canes and tin cups.
Listen to Andy, Sean.
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Good morning!
If I had a $100,000 boat, I sure as hell wouldn't leave it anchored alone in the channel.
We got a helluva tide this month.
Chief?
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
What else is there to do?
I'm going.
I got something for you to do tomorrow.
May I have this dance?
Is that what it is?  Dollars? Money?  I'll pay for it.  Take it out of my salary.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Okay, so that's it.
So there's one around here.
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
That's what I said.  Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
I know, I know....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
When?
We're going to die.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
It comes here from Cable Junction.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Heading back?
Do I have to play with the little kids?
You're going out.
Yeah.
No.
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
What's your plan, Brody?
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
You called, Doctor?
He doesn't need the money.  He inherited a fortune.  He kills for kicks.  TV battles between non-predator fish and divers. The diver always wins.
Are you coming...?
No.
I'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
So tell Calvin.
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Who's going to do it?
I want that shark, Kathryn.
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
Not at all.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try...
Give me a ride?
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
You were great out there!
Sean, do you have herpes?
I don't know, what else is there?
Take it up!
Remember, skiers stay up longer.
Now what?
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
What kind of trouble?
Look great, don't I?
How'd you do in school?
I want to see Kathryn.
You and Kathryn gonna stay here?
We're in love.
No, really.  I've never met anyone like her before.  This is it.
We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
Yes, I did.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night....
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
Don't give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I'm trying to get ready for....
How come it's my responsibility?
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
No....
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
We will...We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?
Can I ride one sometime...?
I like Grandma's cooking....
I almost forgot....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
Mom, please don't start that again....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I don't want to talk about that.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
You're always taking time off....
I have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, Ellen Brody.
You sure you don't need glasses?
I can't....
You the architect?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
I don't know what the hell to say....
Still tagging conch?
The stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
You tagging them...?
Stop busting my hump....
What?
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
Okay...we got it together....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
You told me what?
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow....
Gone to Ben Masters' place.  Cow tipping.
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
What?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
What time is it?
It's an "unsolved." They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wanna check it with Taylor, he worked the case.
Maybe?
What do you mean?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Where is everyone?
Let me just keep going a while. She might remember something?
So am I. But where's my money?
Then give me that Zippo.
I had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
Stop it.
Alright, she wasn't lying about the van. But it could have been <u>any</u> van? Any little foreign diesel? .. She's <u>blind</u>, Bro .. It's sad .. She's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. But you're getting far too far into the element, Brother ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
<u>I'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Can't thank you enough, Ross ..
You got a quiet phone somewhere?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
I'm talking, outside the girl?
That's bullshit,
I never asked if he could "see." I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?
What color was it?
No.
Really? What did he say?
You're looking worried again, Helena?
Suzanne? Very pretty. She was a semi- professional model. But a policeman's wife she wasn't. So one day, she just packed it and left. And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
How you doing on those shoes?
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Damn A, it's O.K. With a bit of luck I'm goin home. What we got?
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
The power move is to go unannounced.  Black suit, right?
Ugh!
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
Look, Rod, just get on the camel!
Now what did you lose?
No no. I knew.
We are?
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
What --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room.  Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you.  I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  I missed my wife.  We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  I love you.  You complete me.
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Oh yes.  Jerry Maguire!  My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Not right now, Jerry.
It's a very personal, very important thing.  It's a family motto.  So I want to share it with you.  You ready?
I understand your anxiety.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
Fine.
What --
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
You okay?
Let's go the zoo.
I won't tell.
Can you be quiet?
Eric!
What is it?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
I don't remember
He could have died.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Baryonyx?
We could co-write a paper.
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
NO!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Anything good?
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
Found this, but the battery's dead.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?
How do you mean?
You broke that idiot's jaw for no reason other than your boredom.  Tell the truth, Roland.  Aren't you even interested in knowing this expedition's quarry?
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
It's... behind... us.
Trespassing, sabotage -- you could go to jail just for being here, did you know that?
Their what?
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Why should they?
You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Ask her.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
Mr Nedry, Mr Nedry.  The embryos have to be back here in San Jose by then.
Oh my God.
Once we have control again we - -
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Why would they care what we think?
Wait a minute!  How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - barfs them up - -
You can't hold it by yourself!
C'mon on, this way.
That's right.  Will break through.
Unpredictability....
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Why not?
In a box under my seat.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Tim, are you okay?
Their radio's out too.  Gennaro said to stay put.
Keep absolutely still - - it's vision's based on movement!
What kind of opinions?
Well, it's - - right up your alley.  Look, why don't you both  come on down for the weekend.  Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I've got a jet standing by at Choteau. 
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
Ah - - they're here.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Dad - - Dad - -
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
He left us!  He left us!
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -
What about that other guy?
A house?
Are you going to plead insanity?
He's fucking nuts.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
This is bad, Joe. The Prosecution is already putting together a team of psychiatric specialists. They'll argue exactly the opposite. They'll say he's just pretending to be catatonic and he's completely sane.
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
How long will he need to be asleep?
Cute waitresses?
There's nothing to see here. He sleeps... we record it. That's all that happens.
What are you doing?
How's that possible?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You've been with the firm for nearly nine years.  You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score.  But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.
... My ... social situation?
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
I'm sorry, but I just wondered --
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here?  This will always be the ghetto.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
I nominated you as a possible candidate.  You were Eduard's good friend.  He read me some of your work.
Burgel gave me this -- what does it mean?
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Well -- other departments are, yes.
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
The fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.
What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann?
I'm overworked as it is.  "Raban" did you say?
It's gone out so quickly?
All these in the last year?
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
It's the same image - Kong!
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
They' re dead.
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Holy shit! Look at the size of that!
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
Sure dear, yes.
Mm.
-- May I? It's so --
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
No.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
Oh no, I don't think --
My name's John Klute.
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
No.
And I don't think that was Tom.
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Mm.
How can you do it to yourself?
No, you can find some other way.  Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
With Trina.
I called Trina.
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
What?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
Then, close the case.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Well as a matter of --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
Some mistake perhaps that --
Someone's been doing all these things.
What?
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
What's in it?
Two years ago? Sorry.
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.
Mr. Kramer?
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Welcome to the greatest show on earth.
Greatest...
Mom, I mean dad...
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Yeah?
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Uh huh...
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Did you wish to?
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
Was he unfaithful?
Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think--
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
I'm not taking him with me.
What?
You have?
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
What?
'Night, Jim.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
You dope.  O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy.  All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being.  Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
What?
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
Fine.
Any prospects?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
Look, Ted, all I--
Listen, Joanna Kramer's got a goddamn good life.  She's got a husband that loves her.  She's got a terrific kid.  She's got a wonderful home--
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
How many onions does it say to use?
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Thelma, if I die--
Ted, I don't understand a word you're saying.  Where's Joanna?
All quiet?
Not the way to talk to people.
No.
I do, now.
Goodbye, Kundun.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
With much bloodshed.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Oh, no. Where will he go?
Your father had been very sick.
I need to squeeze this brain.
I am him.
In the Pacific Ocean.
What is the size of our army, now?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
Please, come in, so cold.
You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
I have more men.
I want to go down there.
We have enemies.
The people want you made Dalai Lama.
Am I running away?
It is possible, Holiness.
Too young?
We won't let him get hurt, Ma'am.
Ma'am.  Your husband, Bernie.  You didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
Why are we landing?
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
Go!!!
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
And what would he do come winter?
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
He didn't eat the kid cause he'd just swallowed a bear.
I got something on the screen.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow.
He was an Indo-pacific.
I'm okay.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
So I don't like tents, why--
Well.  You don't have to <u>stay</u> out <u>here</u>, why don't--
If this is who I <u>think</u> it is.  It <u>is</u>.
Yeah.  Nobody saw <u>anything</u>?
I didn't say it like that.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
What?
Calm down.
Are we crazy?
Well...
It can't work.
Hector!!
You sure?  I don't mind...
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
We shouldn't even really be doing this.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
I wouldn't.
I'm fine, thank you.
Well.  At wakes.
You talk to the married couple?
What?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
You have a thing against museums?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Yes, <u>camp</u>, I thought that meant Holiday Inn, I never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
Why does everybody insult my intelligence, I have intelligence, intelligent people eat Twinkies.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
I'm sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
I had a great time last night. Again.
This is what we do?
Are you on drugs?
I <u>tapped</u> you.
Kevin told me you were upset.
I don't know! Get me out!!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
You're out of line, Starling, and you're off this case. Back to Quantico.
Jack Gordon.
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you?
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
I have no doubt of it.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
I never thought about it.
Who killed your patient?
They all were.
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
I - ran away...
You said - I was very close to the way we'd catch him.
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
He kills w-
Thank you, Clarice.
Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this.  He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin.
Are you alright?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
The Ottawa are gone.
In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance...
What is it?
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
What?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Some say that's the way of it.
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Fort Edward, then?
Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France?
Ottawa!
And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the French!
Many men here, their homes are in the path.
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Sir!
First rank! Second rank! Present arms! 
Sergeant Major!
We must... stop... soon. Women are... tired.  You... understand?
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
British promises are honored. And the militia will not be released. Because I need more definite proof than this man's word!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Their arms?
Granted.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
You mind if I take a look at this?
I'm not a doctor.
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
It's got Hazy!
Can you fix it?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Your suit, Becky!
Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  Bowman and Sixpack...living quarters...
What?
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
You think I should hang around more with the crew?
What are you doing?
Where's Doc?!
Something wrong, Cobb?
Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
It...almost got you.
Listen to it for Christsake.
Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland--and this country's the size of East L.A., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? Fifty-four!
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
The infirmary?...
We've got to get him to the infirmary.
It would explain the suction- like appendages.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
What's wrong?
Don't spend all day down there.
How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
A what?
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
They were . . .
Yeah, Bazza, what?
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
What can I do for you?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.
No.
And the weed?
Go on.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Look. Go on, look.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
How many feet?
The money, the gear!
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
No, sir--
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Nice job.
Charley Wade.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
Colt Peacemaker.
Just wondering.
It's your deal. You sweated it out of him, you pick it up.
You feeling bad for Jimmy? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he run a place on the other side. Those old boys in Ciudad Leon--
You ever shoot anybody was looking you in the eye?
You still going to all the home games?
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Where'd he get all this?
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Dad--?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
How's your room shaping up?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Right.
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
Mikey--
It's a .45.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
You spoil 'em, Cliff.
It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post--
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
Why would you want to do that?
Eladio Cruz.
Reputation?
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Senora Cruz?
I thought you were married!
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
'57, 1 believe--
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Never heard from him again?
Hey, Sam.
Steve called for you.
Why would I want to go there?
I never said that. It was just that boy--
I've seen 'em.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
What?
Mom?
Yeah?
Can I get this?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
We haven't talked since high school.
Yeah.
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
I been working on a few things.
How 'bout you?
I didn't want to be going around your back.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
So when did Buddy leave?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Who?
Why?
I could have lost my fucking hands.
What about death?
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
They were jealous of him.
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
It was more than that, I think.
So Swann was performing magic. not illusions?  And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
I told you --
And they all came...
Oh God!
It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good.
Oh God.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
Trickery and divinity.
I heard he was the best.
Just tell me about Swann.  Or are you too scared?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
What the fuck are you doing here?
I want to speak to Dorothea.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Was that Swann's idea?
Don't bother.
What about?
Does anybody?
Yes...
That.
For an introduction.
That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
A lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Oh Jeez.
Didn't know you read minds.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Did she know where Nix was buried?
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Yes.
Nobody's better off this wav!
Jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Can you do it?
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Yes! Yes!
Wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
Two years.
What did you study?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Hello?
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
That's ok.
We established that we have no communication.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
How old is she?
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
When are you leaving?
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Mr. Harris?
Alright?
Oh, come on.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Hospital?
Uh...sure...I...what?
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
She's been stalking you, Peter.
And how would you describe him?
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Sure it is.  If the guards did this, we can file charges.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
No, I wasn't, actually.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
I've had it.  Townsend's dead.  The police are calling and now I see you having a scene in front of the children. I'm sorry, Maya, you've been with us for many years, but effective immediately, I'm rescinding your right to live at the church.
You'll do it?
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
I'll bet.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
So...what did you think of the tape.
I had to.
We need to talk.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?!?!
We needed to know all we could.
What's the bible for?
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
He was trying to tell me something.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
We need all the help we can get.
He can see you Thursday.
The police used him as a witness in this case.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
What do you mean by that?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Thanks for handling this.
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Parents died?
What happened?
Where is she now?
Huh?
It means a lot that you came by.
That too tight?
Mom's going to hate it.
Mom tell you to do this?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
Monica, I think her point is...maybe it's time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
I know.  But chances are...
What's up with that?
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
I was just playing ball.
Well, what do you know.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
So how come you could play basketball?
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't care.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
Kay.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So she's honest.
I don't.
See you made it.
Why?
What'd it say?
You do see me standing here, right?
It's okay, little baby.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Hey, what's up.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
We won the championship.
Actually, I don't...
What do you mean?
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
It just isn't.
What?
you woke me up to tell me that?
I'll play you.
Hey, girl.
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
We were just studying.
Okay.
You hearing me?
This is just about money, you know that.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Tell me what?
And some things should never fucking happen!
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
You want me to fuck off?
Your teeth are straight.
You ok?
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
You fuckin' don't do that. You don't do it, you cocksucker. I'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  Go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
What's wrong?
Hello?
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Oh that's good.
It's a helluva disease.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Don't sit down.
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
Yeah, but I don't know --
ok.
Yeah.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
No.
Do you wanna go tonight?  I mean, are you working?
Great, bye.
ok.
What?
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
I'm sorry --
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Yes.
How much time do we have?
Not enough, what do you want?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
Son, please, now....
No school today.  My teacher got sick.
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
-- I told you who did it and you're not listening to me.
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but I believe it's that sort of love. Sounds nice to me.
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
Mmm.Hmm.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
Gently, son --
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
-- I give you money, I give you a paycheck. Your sales suck, Don. I give, I give. When I find you, when I meet you, what? I put you on the billboard, I put you in the store, my salesman, my fucking representation of Solomon and Solomon Electronic, Quiz Kid Donnie Smith from the game show --
I paid you back.
What is that?
Braces?
Phil's one of the nurses from the service?
How's today then?
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Get a girlfriend.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
-- just to clarify --
Are you asking me that?
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
And that's what you've heard?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?
Hollywood, mainly.
Are you close?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
When they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. I mean: I'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but I'd never heard the tapes ....
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I don't think, he can't...
Quietly, slow down, whoa --
You're just come in --
Calm down.
Mischief?  What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
--- What was that?
Yes.
Are you ok?
You're my handsome man.
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
Will that help?
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
Who?
hey.
That's it.
How long with Ellen?
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I think that you know.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
Are you her boyfriend?
I'm Bob.
You're her boyfriend?
No.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
....it's alright....
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
Be ready at two --
I'm fine. I'm fine, I just wanna keep playing --
Yes.
Go to bed.
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
I have money to give you.
What is that?
I am King, Mother!  And I do not wish to discuss this with you.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
Louis, please -- !
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
You seek facts, when it would be better to seek truth.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Do you think I have not considered that?  I have a plan -- and you may rest assured that it is brilliant!
You can do it.
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Aramis!  Athos!  He looks exactly like... exactly like...
D'Artagnan, unready?
"Phillippe has been removed to the Bastille, to the lower dungeon.  At midnight tonight I will order the guard changed, and will delay the replacements for ten minutes.  That should give you ample time.  Never have I needed more to say:  One for all, and all for one.  D'Artagnan."
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Do I look all right?
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
What hope is there?  A wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that?  Fromberge is on the battle line, and Raoul --
Raoul is hurrying to the front, so I must hurry too.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
What is its antidote?
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
At least help Raoul.
... The ball... Continue.
You dead yet?
Yes, yes, go on.
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Ah yes, the riots.  We have food stocks on the wharves right now, no?
You mean shut your ass down!
Bullshit...
What the hell happened?
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
If you can trail him to a remote area do it. We all want a piece of him but let's keep our heads and stay within the law - we got people everywhere out here.
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
And what did he do to the girl?
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
Who is it?
Up north.
You always carry a gun with you?
I had it all on tape...
You are drunk.  You know, it's been a long time and I'd love to catch up, but I really got to -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
You must be going somewhere.
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Why aren't you ever alone with him?
What have we missed?
How long do I have?
No.  I don't like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
Why not?
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What's one way?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
Who is it?
There's no connection between the families.
It does, doesn't it?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
I'll see you later. All right?
It's me.
Am I alone in this room? Are you here...  Why are you doing this?!
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Oh, God.
Come in.
Linda King's desk.
She doesn't have a Rolodex.
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
No. I can help you.
He's misunderstood.
He may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Blue, then.
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
You haven't smoked in two years.
Can you quit?
And... where are things?
Will? Are you okay?
Let's forget who said what to whom...
That's right.
Yes. Who are you?
Are you gonna kill him?
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
Of course, you don't.  I'm glad you came. My callers are all professional. Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. Second-raters, the lot.
You had disadvantages.
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Tank you veddy much.
I refuse.
Andy?
You must take a little pleasure in it.
I can't move my arm.
Hi... am I late?
Hi...
Do you wanna to go to Memphis and get married?
And all this will be for real?
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
You're a wimp.
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
What is this, World War Two...?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Sir, do you have a problem?
I was very original!
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Look -- I gotta be clear with you. Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.
Can I help you with something?
Sure!  But WE think it's kickass! Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
Where?
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Does that surprise you?  It was inevitable.
Expect it.  Did you get anything from the room?
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Smith.  I am Agent Smith.
Sorry.
No, it's all right.
How?
Thanks... for the drink.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Just get me outta here.
Yes.
Goddamnit!
What is he doing?
What the fuck do they want with me?!
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.
What do you know?
... Yes.
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
The pill you took is part of a trace program.  It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
What are you doing?
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
More important than what is when?
How did I beat you?
Do you understand, Neo?
No you don't.  Did you see the woman in the red dress?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
Morpheus, I don't know --
That vase.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Who are you?
What is the Matrix?
What happened?  What did you see?
That I would have to make a choice...
I'm coming with you.
Morning.  Did you sleep?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
You're going to kill him?  Kill Morpheus?!
What just happened?
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Uh...can we give you a check?
Keep quiet about this.  I don't have any license for him yet.  I've only had him a couple of days. Nobody can feed him except me.  I'm the only one he trusts.  Watch.
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
And I wouldn't call it TONY'S PLACE or CHARLIE'S PLACE...  I'd call it something like SEASON OF THE WITCH... get it?
Prophesy to us, oh Christ!  Who is it that struck thee?
Look at her.
Nervous?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
Panther...
Panther!  Same thing...
Waddaya think?
The number was 235 - I bet it combination.
You got some mouth!
Didn't show up.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
Don't come any closer!!!
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
I should know?  His wife don't even know.  Probably off with one of his little girls...I don't know.  I tell you, if he don't give a damn, then I don't give a damn...Why should I kill myself?
Michael, believe me.  You know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  I vouched for him and he'll come through.  I promise.  I'll talk to him and straighten him out.  Don't worry, OK?
Hey, shut up.
Disgraceful.
How much?
$20.
Charlie, this is business.
He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?
Fine.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Teresa.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Charlie...?
Alright... Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
Sure...He lives there?
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Don't count it...it's all there.
Hey... you got stereo.
Sure.
Yeah.
That's your name?
Look who's talking.
Dinner?  Again?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
I hate parties --
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Annie made them.
I don't like cake.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
Yes, sir?
What are you eating.
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
...See you tomorrow night.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.
Thank you.
Yes.
Of whom?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Did you just hear something?
Do you think I need a haircut?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
What are their feelings?
Yours.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
Don't you want to hear the details?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
And what do I get?
I from dat nex' place.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Can't, sistah.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
What?
How long you here, Joe?
Confused, huh?  About what?
How did you meet?
She's in a great deal of pain.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I am, too.
Why?
I don't know who you are.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
I love you in an evening gown.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Will it?
What will we do?
'Love will find out the way'?
Did I say that?
Susan --
You think so?
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
Good morning.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Truly - uh - splendid.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
Hello, Bill.
That's okay.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
'Spooning'?
This universe?
You're what?
So that's what love is?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Okay.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Not exactly.
I guess you have your reasons.
Yes.
It just occurred to me --
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Show me around.  Be my guide.  And in return, you get...
Get what?
The 'question' --
I'm doing great.  You ready?
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
You're only six-five once.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
What is it, Daddy --?
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Then what will you say?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
I'm sorry --
Nothing lasts.
Did I say something wrong?
38.
30.
Should I wear it?
Burt.
What's it like?
How long have I been here?
What makes you think he's my friend?
Last week. Then I rented you another one On top of this.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Thanks.
Do you remember me?
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
So you have information for me?
Why?
They treating you alright?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
There are things you know for sure.
It's not easy to be calm when -
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
On the house.
Well, that's me.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
Mrs. Jankis, what do you want from me?
It's good.
This is your car.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
You said you were leaving town.
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
Why are you here?
I'm gonna ask Natalie what the fuck that was all about.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
What sort of questions?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
You're not coming?
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
Somehow, I'll know!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
* Thank you.							    *
Doing...?
And...?
"And" what?
We're not certain...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
How fast does that go?
Havana.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
How's he not your husband?
I insist.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Yero, by himself?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
Alonzo...
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Anything?
Gina in the Miami pad.  You gonna give me phony denials?
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
Verdado.
Verdado where?
This is Agent James Fujima.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
Okay.  What's up?
What are you talking about?
"Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny."
You're so <u>not</u> the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school.  San Quentin.  Pelican Bay.  Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again...
I gave up nothing on you guys. Don't worry.  I kept you and Rico out of it.  Only the Feds.  They're on their own...it's all their deal, anyway, so fuck 'em.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Meaning...?
This the load you lost a while back?
Don't know what line Morey's in, but myself now, fact is -- I'm a hustler.
You sure you heard what I said?
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You gonna beat me, Joe?
Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx. Don't mind if I do.
Tomorrow when some piece like that's scratching your back in a Fifth Avenue townhouse, where'll your pal Rizzo be? Nedicks.
What's in your socks?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
Miami Beach is the only place for a real hustler. Florida has more rich chicks per square yard than any resort spot in the world. They lie out in their pagodas and pergolas waiting to grab the first jockstrap that passes.
You ain't got a chance in hell. You need threads and glitter, baby. A front, hey?
Where'd that come from?
Kee-rist, you sure are one twisty little bastard, Ratso.
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
Yeah.
Well, just exactly what the hell you think you're gonna do? Die on me?
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
I wet my pants! My seat's all wet.
Hey, what the hell you doing?
I'm lonesome. I'm lonesome so I'm a drunk. I'm lonesome so I'm a dope fiend. I'm lonesome so I'm a thief, a fornicator, a whore-monger. Poop, I say, poop! I've heard it all and I'm sick of it, sick to death.
Getchmis...?
Yeah.
Two kilos.
Tunnel?
Hey!  I'm getting this together man and I don't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip!  We go through the wall.
You got that, shit face? Asina...
What?
And what do you do when you in the catacombs?
Yeah. How's Mom?
For the money... )
Yes...?
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
How's it feel?
What they give you?
How long?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
What do you mean?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!
What?
What?
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you.  And you must fuck last.
What'd the Prosecutor say?
What's your name?
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
And a right.
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
What?
For Chrissakes, what's the problem? You need a memo every time you fart?
I only got...
It doesn't matter, all right?  It's dead.
Can we get this car there?
My God, what the hell are you...?
What's Manny doing? I can't see him anymore.
We did no impact evaluation.  The consequences of...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Honey, just leave it.
Fuck 'em.  They don't know what they're missing.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
It's me. Can you hear me?
It worked before...
You go first. I'll be right below you.
Your arm, you can't...
That's impossible.  Insects don't...
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
You want me to burn my book?
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Set what up?
Yes. It will be a book in my honor. For saving your life and nursing you back to health. I'll be the first one to read it.  Oh, Paul, you're going to make me the envy of the whole world...
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in.
I'm telling you, I can't.
What?
...have to wait.
My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef.
Annie, what is it?
No, I haven't.
I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here.
Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me?
This is so exciting. It's Windthorne, her first love, right?
Yes, Paul.
Just leave it, all right?
I'm not sure. Maybe nothing.
If I can.
No, the typing kind.
I thought you were over it.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I suppose I did.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Nyah!
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
More like two-two point two million.
Ninety-three point four million.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Well do you disagree with that?
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Say again. Sounds like you're saying 'she's in the building.'
No.  Should I?
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
- torque wrench.
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
Awfully short notice..
They've got a book for this?
And six billion in the world.
Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands.
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Yes?
- Michael, his driver's an Aussie, new to me.  Then there's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house.
Nyah, it's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
I guess I lied..You can't get both of us out of here, can you?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
You mean it'll be difficult.
They're ready and waiting.  You'll soon be with old friends.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..I'm fine..and you?
That simple, huh?
A visit from an old friend.
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
You knew about Jim?
Satisfied?
What happened to Jim?
There was nobody on the bridge.
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
Claire...Hey...
This is Kittridge.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that..  With that exceptional piece of work.
Luther, I guess you're all out of excuses.
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
It's all one big negotiation, isn't it?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Really?  And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
Why, may I ask?
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Would you remove your hat please?
I thought I was going to see Max.
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
Kitteridge.  Oh my god!  Kittridge is the mole?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
I usually am.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Look to your right, then back to me. There's a camera built right into the bridge.  Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  Can you hear me?
Jack...that's spying.
No, I'm going.
Uh-huh
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Yes.
Where's Ma?
In a month.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
He did?
It's temporary.
What are you doing here?
You're married.
You're my father.
You haven't once said you like my dress.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Yes!
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
That's it.
You don't have to help me.
Seven years ago.
Stupid yourself.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
To the bed.
What about Johnny?
What?
Oh my God.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
Don't just become excited.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Hi.
Thank you!
It's really cold.
I know what I know.
This is your place.
I'm really afraid.
Ronny!
Is Johnny here?
No. I'm gonna wait.
What!
Bye, Aunt Rita.
No?
What's the matter?
Will you marry me?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
I like this ring.
Then let's set the date.
We should talk alone.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
How's the mother?
Hi.
WHAT!! She was dying!
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
He should pay.
So.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Who was that?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Do you have a girlfriend?
People home.
I'm a little cold.
Look.
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
She's got it.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
...What?
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Oh, Knights of Ni, here is your shrubbery.  May we go now?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
Oh, please!
What?
I move for no man.
Well, what's that then?
Well ... can we come up and have a look?
Well, what are you then?
Who are they?
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
Yes.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Nothing... There's your ninepence.
I'm not quite dead, sir ...
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
What - the curtains?
Herbert.
How?
Well ...
No, It's nothing!
Sir Galahad!
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
Seventy a year.
What?
You know what I mean.
So?  Someone'll send it on ahead.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
She's busy.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Not now he doesn't.  This is my place.
Who'll bring it to me?
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
That can wait till the weekend.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
For Her Majesty.
The greasy pole.
In time, she will.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
What are those?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Have I ever let you down before--?
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen.  You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Then they may read about me.
Yes.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
What's her excuse this time?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Just them?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
How long has he been this sick?
What do they want?
Ma'am?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
How do you stop The Screamer?
The next half of the game takes place in ARCADE's brain, The City of Truth. It's urban scenarios, lots of metal and concrete. Screamer comes faster here.  On Level Four you can get a free life if you wait until the last possible second before exiting that world.  Gotta time it right though.
No, in person.  Now.
Can you turn off the game?
I'm in the middle of it...
Happy?
So how did it know my name, then?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
What?
It's already out.
You realize that in order to do that, we'd actually have to play the game.
Dante's Inferno.
What are you looking for?
I don't understand.  It wants us to play the game.  It's been taunting us ...
Okay.  It's West.
So that's what we almost died for?
So tell me you're okay, then.
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!
Mom?  You're alive...
Is...is that where we are?  Did I die?
Can you say anything but "cool"?
What's going on, Cynthia?
What did you say?
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
But I'm not broke.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Beautiful night.
Yeah.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
I agree with what you said...truly.
Okay, I'm thinking.
Okay.
I understand.
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Fine. I'll check out in the morning.
I...
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
No.
No...I need to sleep.
You don't remember anything else?
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Strange to be calling yourself.
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Don't stop!
What is it? What do you see?!
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
I just wanted to come here.
Go ahead.
You see what I mean...
Palmdale.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
You must come in first place to move on !
Doesn't it bother you to see this kind of brutal death ? I mean , I can understand the old man's infatuation with the stuff, but not you.
Good morning. What do you have today ?
So where does this lead ?
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
What do you mean ?
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
That's a shame.
Yes, can I help you ? Maybe a donut or something ?
It's fine thanks.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
But, he's...
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
He probably has a history of this shit.
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Yes sir.
That was rather.... disappointing.
I want more action. I want to see more ingenuity than that. I want to see the injured man out wit the machines !
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
Look he figured it out !
Look ! Look !
<<belch>>
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Not now, Mom.
I think we should follow him...
Thanks a lot. I always wanted to know what it was like to see my life flash before my eyes for the one hundredth time tonight.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
UCLA? My cardigan sweater period.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
What about giving the other guy a break.
What do you remember about her.
Do what?
Well you know what I mean.
So, what's on your mind?
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Seriously.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
What boy likes you?
No nuns, got it.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
No.
Oh.  Ohhh?
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
What's the matter?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
Oh please, who do you think you're kidding? And where did she spy on the Russians from, here in Pennsylvania??
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
You know I've been re-reading Virginia Woolf, I think she'd be a natural for you, she led a fascinating life.
You ratted on my mother??
This isn't just a mood ring.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
And you'd be my cousin?
Yeah I guess...sort of.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
What's that?
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
You want me to come with?
Hi!
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
I think this place is just fine.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
So what's wrong?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Well maybe for you.
Is there milk in them already?
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Do you know him?
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
Stiffs??
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Shelly?
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
I love this guy! 
Did I kill my mother?
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
Really?
Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Can we look around in your camper?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
No.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
I like my name.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm eleven and a half.
Oh great!
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Hurry!
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
If I do it, can we go?
No.
What do you think it's like?
Don't DO that!!
Sorry.
Pacifist!
What?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
Got it!
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
Okay, okay.
I honestly wish I could...
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Ben Gay.
Well, we're...
Can you watch the road?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
And loving him means loving all of this.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Exactly.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
I saw the show.
Ex-cuse me?
I thought Michael was picking me up.
I haven't caused... a problem, have I?
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
And she's all wrong for me!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Every day.  She makes the bed.
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You're not eating.
You never eat when you're despondent.
I'm up against a deadline.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
I asked you...
Thank God you were here.
Oh, yeah.
The Big Hurt, huh?
What's up?
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
How did you come in here?
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.
What!
You want anything?  A drink?
National television?
D.C.
You're kidding.
Thanks... I'll... go say hello to your mom.
He's my father.
He got killed at a turkey shoot.
Yes. I was in my Sophomore year at Harvard.
Do you know Barbara Jean?
What?
What did you say?
I see... Well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
Who's that?
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
You in music?
The car broke down.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Yes, it is --
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Oh?
I'm not sure.
I knew when I first met you.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Oh.
You know who that is?
Yea.
They said go see the chaplain.
Hello.
Oh, no.
What National TV...?
Where's Bill?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
You know Bill is really mad at you.
He ain't really new.
Ryan O'Neal.
You got something you want to do?
You're a breathing icon of justice and that's why you were chosen to deliver Mr. and Mrs. Knox. We, the prison board we, knows that once you get them on the road if anything should happen, an escape attempt, an accident, fire, anything...Jack 'Supercop' Scagnetti would be there to look out for his public's best interests.
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Tell me about the purity.
I'm sure we will.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
I could go for a Coke.
Out front.
No. Not really.
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Yes.
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
And a snake-eye glare.
So, Mallory calls 911 and they took off.
Here's the layout of the laundry room.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
And where do you keep Mickey?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Rollin'...and speed!
Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God.
It's gonna be beautiful.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
By taking away our legs. Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you'll find in this gym. Probably the whole city. They gave us the fighting spirit. Before this happened I was content. Now I'm pissed off. Now I'm half a man and I've got to work like the devil to get whole again.
Is that her real name?
Ya know, I was.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Yeah.
Okay.
Name's Duff.
Guess I don't.
Have anything in mind?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Okay.
Your folks live there?
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Get out of here!
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
'Been up north?
No.
What d'you mean?
Thank you.
Don't call them that.
Is that so?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
We can always do that, Duff.
What d'you mean?
I don't think that'll happen.
What's so hot 'round town?
Who're you?
What's on your mind?
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Great.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
How often does he get like that?
Well, what're you going to do?
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
I know.
What's the matter now?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
I will.  Inside.  There's no other way to get the gun off the girl's head, Nate.
You didn't come here to destroy Wintermute. You can to save a man you love. A man who isn't even capable of returning that love. Such a waste...
What you lookin' for, mon?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
He's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. Where's Molly?
Hey, bro.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
You're Dixie McCoy's construct. That makes you something special.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
It's coming.
What about the mainframe's access code?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
I'll be okay.
He projects with neural implants.
...And if I guess wrong?
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Surviving, darling. It's my specialty. Only this time I'm doing it my style. I've beaten him, you know.
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
– uhh, must have forgotten-
What?
YOU DID.
Leave.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Forget it.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
How about this?
You've done five of my ideas.
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Do you even know these kids?
That's your story!
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
Maybe we should go in a different room?
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Better person than I.
See!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Wow. This must be big.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Better than I...
wasn't even thinking about-
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
You have to say that. You're my student.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Our penguin, right?
Do you think you'll find her?
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Into our group.
By name.
He sure is big, Jack...
Yes.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.
Uh-huh.
We're here!  You sent for us!
You got your room straightened out yet?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
Are you nuts or something?  What the hell is that going to do?
How much longer you figure he'll keep us out here?
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
It was okay.
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Are you nuts or something?
You're fucked in the head.
What?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
It's gone now.
yeah, I had a bad night.
You're going out?
We're going up to bed now.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get to the club.
Hi Mom.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
The city that never sleeps.  So what will you do now?
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
You like gymnastics?
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Max, where's Kristen?
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
Fred Krueger's dead.  You always had a little trouble understanding that, Princess.
I think we can stop him this time. Stop him for good.  But we need to know where the bones were hidden.
Crossed over?
Ever work with vets?  These kids act like they've got D.S.S. -- Delayed Stress Syndrome. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they'd seen heavy combat.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
Ms. Thompson.
This is nice.
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
Sounds like a rough time.
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
What are we going to do?
I've heard crazier things this week.
Nancy...
And what are they?
How do we get in?
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
I'm in.
I'm a vegetarian.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
And then I... right.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Coffee?
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
Hi.
Sorry about not ringing back.  The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
She left me.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Well, get a message through to him too.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Well...
How do you think I'm doing?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Does the girl have a name?
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Hello, Bernie.
Of course it is.  Any favourite among the 22?
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
Right -- want another one?
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
So I get the brownie?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Can I help you?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Hey.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I wouldn't go outside.
Why not?
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Get up, Billy.
Easy now, don't smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
H-H-Hearts.
What's your name, buddy?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Come on, don't crap out on me now. We got two buddies out there!
Y-y-yes, a b-b-bus!
'K-Kay, M-Mack!
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Ahhh, Billy...
Say... God Bless America!
Pssst! Hey Rose! There they are!
Yeah, Mack, what is it?
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
It's the questions she asks.
Mine, too!
Neither do I...
Did to me?
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
With your own two hands?
I'm not talkin' to him! I'm talkin' to myself! It helps me think!
Hear what?
What's this?
Right!
I see.
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Come on, Doc, you must be kiddin'.
Candy. Candy, over here.  Hey, Doc, time out.
Are you a doctor?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Because I quit breathing.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
I'll bet a buck you don't do it!
Somebody's coming!
Yeah, take us back to the dumbwaiter, Mac.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
On what?
Don't know if I can hold it that long, Sam.
Huh?
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
Is everything all right?
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
That!
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
What for?
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
A very large pig.
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
How could you do this to me?
You're limping.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
You didn't answer my question.
Why are you asking me this?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
Mickey Spillane.
Hi, Peter.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.
Hey--
Nice dress.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
I know the feeling.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
What?
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I was hoping for the real thing.
I'll look forward to it.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
No.  He smokes.
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
But somebody wrote those songs.
No.  He's never asked me.
Yes you did.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Is that bad?...
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
What?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Why?
I know, but...
Who said I was going?
Amazing...
Oh.
Kate, you're still there?  I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
Right.
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
What?  You know him?
Good strategy.
It'll do.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
Mm—hmmm.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Don't say that!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
Hello, Edie.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
None of your business.
Which side are you with?
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
The moment I saw you.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
Want to go out and have one with me?
In a saloon?
It's quite—  –nice.
How about another one?
I— I'd like to, Edie, but—  —there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says—
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Terry, what's wrong?
You... .
I know what you want me to do!
Charley.
He's going to have to grow up too.
My pigeons... .
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
A question of who rides who.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
D 'n D?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
Are you on the level, Father?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Boy, you must've been up early.
Looking for me?
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
No.
You ought to go home and take care of that—
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap— conniving—good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done— you hear me? —glad what I done!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
A dime. One thin dime for a cup of coffee.
That's life.  My kisses are alive.
Can't we get out of here?
I'm afraid I'll faint.
The ropes are coming loose.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
She was?
When!?
The <b>moon</b> is almost <b>gone!</b>
Oh, if there is only time!
Is there time?
Then it is some service you desire of us.
There are one or two which should complement the night's entertainment, Master
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
He wants us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
He called the day he escaped.
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Adele?  You in there?
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
Just that she got away.
You at least bring the gun?
Just hung up.
How long were you with the girl?
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- <u>alone</u>.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
You know how I felt about her.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
You talked to him?
It was an unusual experience.
I have to qualify, is that it?
That's all I wanted to know.
Call and tell you.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Who was the friend?
Sign says "Shut the fuck up."  Or can't you guys read?
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
So you've done this before, huh?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
Of course I am.
Is that right?
You'd probably tell me.
And your gun.
Think I could have them back?
I'm partial to mountains myself.  But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
It smelled.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
You know I saw you on the street.
To warn her about Chino.
So she did help you?
Come on, Jack -- don't.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
I thought you guys were busted.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
How many?
How are you, Richard?
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Me?
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is <i>my</i> job.  You're either in or you're not.  You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
That was some shit, huh?
Foley?  Oh.  No, it was one of the Cubans.  Linares.
Light to super-middleweight, as my body developed.  You go about what, bantam?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
Thanks, Dad.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
Was it Foley?
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
I found a rubber.
You mean hiding them?
Land of the free...
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Nah, you go on.
How come you're not pukin'?
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
Fun today.  Like old times.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Good luck over there McCawley.  I admire your decision.
Our doctor's gone too.
Win?
How often you fight like this?
Danny's not coming?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
What?...
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Leapin' Jesus!
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Hello, Lilla!
Do you believe in all of that?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Let's go.
r was worried about you  You didn't even call. You're always on my case if I don't call..
How do you like my hair?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
They're waiting. Come on.
I'll call you Later.
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
Welcome to the singles' scene.
And we're here on the couch...
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I know. Put Scott through college.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Refresh my memory.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse?  You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
How'd you know about that?
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Just take a look at it. 
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
I'll never give up.
Hello, Charlie.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
What would that be, sir?
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Hey Terry, what is that?  Did Peggy make it up?  I've never seen that on Bandstand.
There's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons.
If you believe it, darling, then I believe. Being young can be just as confusing as being old. The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
I'd love to.
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
I thought I knew everything about him.
Young lady, you're drunk!
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
I closed my Christmas club.
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
How do you feel?
Sort of.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
What does Charlie think about that?
Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me.
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Dancing with you.
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
So are you. You've got a vision.
Wait! I'll go with you!
That's Renee alright.
Wait, there must be some mix-up. He was... the dog is alive.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Who was that?
"Out." Well that's great, Geoff.  Look, I've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I'm not going to stand for crap like this. I don't care if it's Halloween... it's a school night, and if you do this again...
Damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. I swear that dog's an idiot.
What was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
This is it... I wasn't sure if it even really existed.
Do you think everyone that came back would be like Gus?
You ever think about running away?
In a word, Bob...
Yes!
I almost didn't make it to the bathroom, Miguel. I almost lost control right in front of everybody.
Don't apologize for me.
You're going to the office?!
What's wrong with you?
Close the law book.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
I'm not ready to die.
We've been talking it over, Andy. Your future that is... We feel that, because we respect you so much, we have to be honest with you.
This is my partner. We keep records of hospital visits. Nothing personal.
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
It's okay. Can I sit down?
Little baby girl.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
We?
Who'd you get?
I'm a law suit.
Sure. It's fine.
When you refer to Wheeler, call him Charles, to show how you'd been admitted to the inner circle, you were considered one of them.
What have you prayed for?
We proceed, representing your estate.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
Can you see the lesions on your chest in this mirror?
Gay movies.
No.
Absolutely.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Is that a question?
It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree?
Second.
What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Who?
Okay, Joe...
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Have you changed your aftershave?
Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Whoa, whoa...  What do you expect them to say, you're Alan Dershowitz?
In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
Charles...
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to...
You came for us....
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Why, what'd you hear?
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some time to think.
Back to the ship, huh?
One or two.
You sure you can keep --
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Just give me your hand.
Can we switch?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
You have a little caffeine in the morning, I have a little morphine. So what?
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
For your own fear.
How much?
The sled as a shield....
New Mecca....
We crossed our own tracks.
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
<u>Trawl</u> with it. There's a cable on the sled. We can drag the body behind us.
Nice embellishment.
An' this?
You were tryin' to kill him too.
Take it.
Dr. Zaius --
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
Flight is a scientific impossibility.
'I am not a missing link.'
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
Which direction?
That way.
Hmph.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
I admit, I know nothing of your culture.
Did you see that? It's remarkable!
What happened?
All right --
And the glory, don't forget that. There's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It's probably turned green by now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we forget our heroes.
We got off at the wrong stop.
So you can talk.  I'm Dr. Zira's nephew. This abduction was her idea. You're not really going to the zoo. That's just our cover story in case we're stopped.  Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property --
The Hunt Club.
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
You lied. Where is your tribe?
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Sure.	In a cage.
Speak! Go on.	Speak again.
Yes.
You want her that much?
Like you, I find it difficult.
But there's the doll, sir.
But the proof? The doll?
I SHIT on all o' you.
Yeah, what is it?
Fuck you bitch.
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
You guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'Lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a Heaven - and god, I hope so - I know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause HIS PAINS HE DONE LEFT DOWN HERE. Baaaaaaaaa! 
I was wrong.
Where's Lerner?
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
What you got there - beers?
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
You wanted to see me sir?
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
No thanks?
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Okay. You win.
Immigration Officer?
I'm Miss Mayfield. Is Mr.  Campbell here?
Bank?
No, please.
Your liquor laws..
You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
Do you think I don't?
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Go ahead...if you want to. It doesn't matter.
What time is it?
Absolutely sure.
You don't know who he is?
Take me home--and forget you ever saw me. That's a silly remark isn't it?
Nothing matters.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
You'll be safe here.  I won't be long.  Help yourself to anything you want. The galley's through there.  You can make coffee if you like.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
That man that was following us last night--he didn't come back this morning.  I'm beginning to wonder about him, too.  Was he really following me--or you?
You-killed-him?
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Me?
Where's you get it?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
Is it a crime?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
We try to be decent.
If I understand what you meant by that.
To do what?
You asked for it.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
That's a nice hard knee you've got, Goble. How'd you like to trade it for a broken neck?
Got the information on you?
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night
Leave that one lay.
Thank you.
Where?
It was lying where on the balcony?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
You asked me where it all came from.
How would you know, Brandon?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
What are you doing here?
Got a moment, Inspector?
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
What do I get for it?
So the shell ought to have gone over?
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
Ye have, have ye?
And in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Get out of here!
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Right.
It's kind of you to see me.
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
Of course.
No.  I'd want to--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
Can I give you a lift?
Oh, but he was terrific.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
How nice.
Again?
Any sign of the goddess Barrington?
That's enough of that.
What have you been up to?
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
Yes, finally.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
Thanks.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
I just might give you a ring when we get back to London.  There's one or two things I'd like to... Will you let me have your number before you leave?  Have you ever watched a commercial being made?
We'll see what we can do.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
Thanks for stepping in.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Why should I?
Yeah?  What?
Sir?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
A little mushy.
Babes.
Surgical.  Look at them separate the dye packs.  Dick and Ronny know their jobs.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
... so I started tailing him.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Time for lunch.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?
Strange, Major. There was a firefight. Shooting in all directions.
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
It was all bullshit. All of it. From the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
Blain...  ... Just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
What, Sergeant?
Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. We'll bury him in the morning.
He knows our defenses.
Mr. Harris, we know you've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
We can reach an understanding on this.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
It's... it's not like that.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
No, you look like a hooker.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
New York.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
For an hour.
You're joking.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Fine.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Get in.  This side.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let's talk some more first.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Good morning.
Where'd you go?
Mmm, I could tell.
All right, two thousand.
Done.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I think you'll approve.
I have work to do.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
You won't.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
But don't they have it in English?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
My what?
Cynthia's not coming?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
Who did you think?
Yeah... I know what you mean.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Dummy.
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
I'm just going to my room.
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
With pride. What can I do for you?
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
I only dog paddle.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
Hello.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
Where did you get that?
A book?
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Oh no. No, please.
Yes.
What? What?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Now, mostly dead is slightly alive. Now, all dead...well, with all dead, there's usually only one thing that you can do.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Do you always begin conversations this way?
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Because I know something you don't know.
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
I want to duel him left-handed.
You know what a hurry we're in.
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
Australia.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Then make your choice.
You guessed wrong.
What?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
"Of the silvery moon,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
Mr. Bialystock ...
Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army.
So much for Nutsy Fagin.
Maybe it's not true!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
Vhy do you persecute me?  My papers are in order.  I love my country.  "Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber vaves of grain."
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
Yes.  We would!
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
I shall count the minutes.
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
The Blue Max...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
What did you tell the people?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
She isn't still here, is she?
Of course not.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
Your mother met her?  Can I talk to your mother?
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
I'm in no mood for trouble!
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
I think you'd better give it a trial spin. Don't want any bad word of mouth about California Charlie.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
It was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
Maybe we can handle it together. 
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Yes.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
What makes you sound so certain?
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
I'd like to, but...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
Wait a minute!
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
My mother is not dead!
Shut up!
Yes.
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
That's only natural. Maxwell will be here around eight tonight.
You--a friend to me?
That sounds to me very remarkable.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
You're losing your blood?
Yes!
Did you hear?
Yes.
I don't agree with you.
I think so.
She isn't anybody's friend, and I don't like you living with her. She's a bad influence.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
It happens that I'm the law.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
Where did you get the news item?  From a little bird?
Meaning what?
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
And how does one go about getting these human documents, may I inquire?
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
I asked you to keep your trap shut!
We'll grant that.
What do you mean?
No kiddin'?
Go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. I don't feel like talking to you.
Yes, sir. I got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
Call the Homicide Squad!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
Do you know George Winton?
Where'd you get the stag hound?
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
He might get some publicity out of it.
I'm after news, as usual. I wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
What was her name?
Where to?
Why am I doing this?
I've been dreaming about this.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Nobody.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Buddy, you're just a child.
I said I wouldn't.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
Neither do I.
I do, too!
Well, a little.
I don't know. But you better watch him like a hawk, if he comes back again.
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
It's pitiful. Neither one of them know.
She's watching the car again?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
Mother is struggling desperately. In fact she's fighting like a tiger. But I don't know, it's close, it's mighty close.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator.
You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
She already told you, she doesn't know.
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Rose, what are you doing up?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes?
Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job.
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
Ha ha, course you make a lot more.  What's that you got there, Buddy?
Galley proof.
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
Let me be the judge of that, Madam.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Have I ever steered you wrong?
Come on, don't you screw with her, please!  You... you got to want this: armored car job.  CalTrust Bank. They took two million in cash...
She's right.  If you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
This is too fast.  This is <U>way</U> too fast!
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
Okay, we got... one, two... three...  Two Caddies and Poe's Mustang.
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Wh... what... ?!
When you planning to cut back on that?
You don't smoke.
Why do I always have to sit in back?
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Maybe.
You can't be serious.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Oh yeah?
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
Any preferences?
Come again... ?
Get his attention.
You suck at lying, Archie.
No more counting the big money for someone else.
They're... around.
We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our cruisers can't repel firepower of that magnitude.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
Wouldn't miss it.
Hey, are you awake?
What's going on?
Lando, grab it!
Good luck.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash.
Over there! Two more of them!
I know, father.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
Master Yoda, you can't die.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
We must have a blow-out.
I'm coming with you.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
I'm Brad Majors and this is my fiancee, Janet Vice.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
...Fine.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
Looks quiet, y'know.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
Yes.
Would ya take off your glasses?
I always knew you was pretty.
Don't want weak legs.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
That so.
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
He got lucky.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Fouls.
Joe Zack is a good prospect -- Exciting boy.
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
No wine.
...That's an old one.
That's ten bucks.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Bob.
That's it.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya still light seventy.
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
Mr. Balboa --
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
Come July, twenty-five.
Rice is a bum.
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Think about it.
Yeah -- See the fight last night? Apollo Creed beat that English guy bad.
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Looks, huh?
Hey --
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
How ya feelin'?
What?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
How will you fight Apollo Creed?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
Being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  What were you looking for, Mr. Valiant?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
They?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Don't you think anyone's gonna notice that Toontown's gone?
No, no, no... I love my husband.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
Now what?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
I've already seen your photographs.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Oh, Eddie, that was quick thinkin'. Nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
Me.
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Say Roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the Ink & Paint Club?
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Then I'll leave thee.
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
'Tis he.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Amen
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
If my heart's dear love--
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
This is important.
Why did you do that?
We kept it...
And then Sam, you and I clean up whatever's left to be cleaned.
It's good to see you've all got such faith in our little undertaking.
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
This...this is incredible. Is the rest of Europe like this?
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
From Interpol?
Nobody's saying they don't.
I bought it for him -- all the stuff he was using, it was in his contract.  Cost a nice penny, too, especially that goddamned phone: Gregor had expensive tastes.
Are you alright?
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
Alright, Gregor, I'm...
Go ahead, shoot... Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.
Don't do it, Sam!
We'll double your price.
No, Mikhi, I wouldn't.  Since I won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, English will do nicely.
Edvard said the same thing about you before he died.
Don't talk to me unless you tell me what I want to hear, understand?!?  You have no choice in this, don't think about winning, think about staying alive.  I want the item, and if you don't give it to me, I'm gonna kill you.
Gregor, is that you?
Don't cross me...
Soon.
You should watch what you eat.
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Sorry I'm late...
He trusts you to lock up?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
What's going on?
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
Alright, it's done.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Very ugly.
I never made that claim.
Business keeps you on the road?
You have to stop doing that!
You speak French.
You sure?
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Ready to roll, partner?
Never heard of it.
What the hell...
Call it in I guess.  Why?
No.  We can't.
We don't know that.
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
I don't know...
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
Do you have everything?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
That's right.
Booth, listen to me...Booth!
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Whoa, Earl!
Thank you.  Now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
What for?
Yeah.
Nothing's wrong.
Yeah I'm fine.
How the hell did he find it?
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
It doesn't matter...he's next to you.  You know, I always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. Why didn't you?
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Why does that bother you?
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
Uh...C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Very clumsy, very clumsy.  I’d have found it in a minute.
Jesse?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
About what?
I  have complete faith in you. But don't you go speeding.
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
I'll settle for a third of that.
Meet me at the Tumbleweed Diner.
What?
People have been asking me about that story in the paper.  I told them you were the first person on the scene.  They were asking me for all the details.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
And what happened?
Don't you want it?
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
Yeah.
I've waited my whole life for this job, but I don't have a shot in hell of getting it.  Do you know why?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner!  Four, winner!
What?
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
I knew you were lying.
I'm sorry.
You lied to me.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
It's my job!
You.
He found out his partner, Tan, had been working for the Triads all along.  Before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
What?
How do you know he's our man?
You sound like that all the time.
He'll be back soon.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
She saved our lives.
Fine by me.
No mu-shu.
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Dancing?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
Is this a payoff?
How do I know I can trust you?
Who the hell is that?
Lee!  It's him!
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Shut up!
You speak English!
I am afraid I don't understand the importance of this information.
That silly-ass look on your face.
Shortcut?
What?!
I am from outa town.
No, it is China, my country, my history.  If any of it gets damaged...
No shark fin, no camel hump.  What you listenin' to?
You got a lot of guts calling me.
Oh my god...what happened to you?
We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
At this point we don't have much.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
What kind of assignment is that?
Don't play bullshit games with me.
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Yes.
Yes.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Yes.
And Mr. Lee?  Where is he?
I was trying to find the right time.
I'm not running.
What do you expect me to say to this?
Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  The rest weren't so bad.
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Of course.
"Nothing but net."
Rub your ears.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Okay, we'll order out.
And you defending her?
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
It's nice that they're still friends.
We'll see.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
I think so.
You afraid to try?
I'll have the same.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
That's called changing your mind.
Well, you do have the dress.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
You're a goddess!
Ya think?
Where?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
You don't love me, is that it?
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
But it's on the water.
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I love you.
I'll wait.
Happy New Year, darling.
About forever.
I do.
So what happened?
What's with you?
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
I should say something in this about magic.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
He lost all the weight... there.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
Thank you.  I love you.
I love you, too.
This is a photo of hair.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
Yes, I did.
You know.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Grace heard it.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Sam, if you're not doing anything New Year's -- obviously you're not doing anything New Year's -- we're having some people over, all of them married, not one even remotely interested in playing around.  Does that sound great or what?  I can't think of the last time I was at a party when anything actually happened.
It's not that late in Seattle.
And you're worried about him.
Why not?
It is not --
When's the latest time you were out there?
What is it?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Does red pepper go under R or P?
Hi, Dad.  Dad, this is Jessica.
I know.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
Jonah!
No.
Have you seen my wallet?
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Okay.
Do you like it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
I really wanted you to call me, and I thought you were never going to --
You could have called me --
It takes time --
Want to go up to your office, Mr. Alexander?
Take a drink. Calm down!
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
I checked the drift just before he blasted. It was all clear ... The man must have been asleep or something.
Are you sick, Mama?
Forget it.
Now don't start talking against the union again.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
You mean Delaware?
It's possible. Just negotiate.
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Rhymes with Simmy.
Yeah.
Who wouldn't?
First rate, ain't it?
Yeah.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
Then leave.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Oh. Hi.
Like you?
Ass first into the world.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
How the hell did we get this detail?
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Jimmy, where do you find these people?
You wanna score some go-fast?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Was he the president?
Danny?
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?
Never mind.  Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
Cut the shit, Flynne.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Jesus.
That's him.  He's a lot prettier in person though.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
To who?
We know what's going on.
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Lay off, Garcetti.  I'm not in the mood.
There's no motels around here.
What do you mean?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Don't worry about it.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
But, sir...I...I...
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Last I knew.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
So, that's Ryan.
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Yes, sir.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Say what, Cap'n?
How about that jeep?
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It seemed appropriate.
What is it?
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Three for three.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
How about...?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
And how do you bluff yourself?
That's the rub.  I liked Wade.  Who's Ryan?  If they're both standing in front of me and I have to shoot one or the other, how do I choose?  Look at my hand, there it goes again.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Uh, oh.
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
So, you ever heard of employee discounts?  My uncle sells shoes, gets twenty-five percent off everything in the line, got a closet filled with the best looking shoes you ever seen.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, I gotta tell you, the irony of this mission is fucking killing me.
Ours is not to reason why.
In addition, as I pointed out earlier, I have a fondness for cheese and I hope to have the opportunity to sample some of the Ramelle products, when we arrive there, to see if they live up to their excellent reputation. Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private James Ryan and I'm more than willing to lay down my life, and the lives of my men, especially you, Reiben, to help relieve her suffering.  The men thoroughly enjoy the performance.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
You're only allowed to shoot at Germans, that's one of the rules.
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Yes, sir.
So what?  I've got three satchel charges, six gammon grenades, a dozen- and-a-half pineapples, and all my regular gear.  You don't hear me complaining.
Fertilizer, Captain, I think we're in a cranberry bog.
Pardon me?
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
I'll take the whole set.
Yeah.
What's a scam?
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 
So, what's your point?
I don't feel anything.
One hundred thousand dollar fine and three months?
What are you doing?
What?
I won?
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
You should be.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
You're going.
Dad, are you okay in there?
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey!
Swear to god.
No, but you stole from them.
I made their lives better.
Hi.
If we could just talk about boys everything would be so much easier.  You know, your room is always ready for you, you can always come home if... alright, what do you want me to do?
Yeah.
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Well...
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Sure I do.
Twisted?
You know what?
Basic.  Hmmm.
So what's your job this summer?
You think so?
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Yeah.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Okay, this is important...
I don't think so.
Then why are you shaking?
It sounded like you did.
No I didn't.
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
I'm totally and completely serious.
You're not a permanent part of her life.  You're a distraction.
No way.
Oh boy.
Now you're back.
What's your name?
Sir, the list is correct.
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
All right, okay, let's talk.
You took my workers.
That's great, thanks.
Like this?
What's wrong with it?
Good.  How's it going?
Jews, yeah.  Investors.
I got to go, I'll see you.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
There will be generations because of what you did.
He's stealing from you, Oskar.
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
What? I can't hear you...
Cici. Who's this?
Who do you want to speak with? Nobody's here.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
It helped me realize one thing.
Why don't you ask them?
Finish what my son started.
I could use some therapy.
Lemme take you home.
No. This is a set up.
Poor Cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
We have our own website now. We dedicated a whole page to you.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
You’re the one who got away.
A twist ending if you will.
Oh yeah.  We figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. It’s been an ongoing discussion.  Heads or tails?
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Not good. How you doin?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
No, wait...
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
It's good to see you involved.
Sid, I'll come with you.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
I got a surprise for you.
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
Can I come with her?
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I'll be right back.
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
What kind of a game?
Closer than you think.
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
The killer leaves a newspaper clipping at each murder, Sidney. Recently he's also left a photo of your mother.
Oh yeah, how?
What about Angelina Tyler? She was there too.
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
No really?
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Are you saying she was-
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
This is Candy.  Hang on, let me get some clothes. See!  I don't' understand why I have to start the scene in the shower!  The whole shower things been done, 'Vertigo' hello!  And I mean, my boyfriend just died, why am I showering?
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Yeah?
Alright I'm here, now show your  face so we can finish this.
You ready to party hard tonight?
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
What are you doing here?
Now that it's out of your system.
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
You don't still think it was me?
What?
Who is this?
Popcorn.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
So you better leave.
No...
I don't know...
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Serial killer is not really accurate, ma'am. The killer has yet to strike twice.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
Any word on my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
You girls ready.
What were you doing out here?
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
What is your problem? You got what you wanted. Cotton Weary is in jail. They're gonna gas him. A book is not gonna change that.
Why would she lie about it?
What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Why would you call me from my front porch?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
...so call if you need me.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
I think her father did it. How come they can't find his ass?
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
I thought everything was checked out.
Do they know who did it?
Tell your mom I said thanks.
I'm not worried.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Come on, Sid.
It goes further back, Sid. There's been talk about other men.
Don't go there, Sid. You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick. Don't freak yourself out -- we've got a long night ahead of us.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
TATUM!
Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened?
For once, Stu, drop it.
With that set of lungs -- she should be.
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
It's none of my business anymore.
Yeah.
It's always been like this.
Thank you.  Tell them, thank you.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
He's being arraigned tomorrow.
What?  What?
I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
We're not just going to pick up two more bodies, are we, Johnny?  That wouldn't be... shocking enough.  Wouldn't keep you on the front page of the newspapers.
A woman...
Not here.
No one yet.
You think it was poison?
Anyway... I did my time on door-to-doors, and walking a beat.  I did all that shit for a long time.
Good.
This doesn't make any sense.
It could be nothing.
He ate his fill, and was forced to continue eating... till his body rejected the food. the killer held a bucket under him, and then kept serving.  He took his time.  The coroner says this might have gone on for more than twelve hours.  The victim's throat was swollen from the effort, and there was probably a point where he passed out.  That's when killer kicked him in the stomach.  Popped him.
It's too soon for him.
Well?
How's that?
All television does is teach children that it's really cool to be stupid and eat candy bars all day.
What about sports?
He must have left another puzzle piece.
Forced what?
No fingerprints?
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!
I wish I still thought like you.
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
Bullshit.
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
We don't know for sure...
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
It's probably nothing, but even if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.  The man at Hot Dog World is a friend, in the Bureau.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
We could use about fifty more men here.
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
The irony is, after a day of the type of work he did, he'd come home and read me these morbid crime stories.  Murders in the Rue Morgue.  Le Fanu's Green Tea.  My mother would give him hell because he was keeping me up till all hours.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
You're talking about people who are mentally ill.  You're...
Tell me it's not true.
I hear you and Mills were high school sweethearts.
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting.  I'm sorry.  It's really none of my business.  It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that.  If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag.  That's how he is.
It's a hard place.
Perfect example.
How's California?
Lucy's going on seventeen now...
It was, I tell you!
You're goin' if the captain says you're goin'...
Got a warrant?
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
I remember...from always...At first I prayed to you...come and get me... Take me home...You didn't come...
Ay-eh...They was here...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
Not quite...Quarter Cherokee. The rest is Welsh...So they tell me.
That don't make 'em kin...
Oh...
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
You figger Scar means to kill us?
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
But I allus loved you...You know that, without my sayin' it...I couldn't bring myself to ask you to wait...the little I had... not knowin' how much longer until we found Debbie...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
Do you know where fuse box is?
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
You?
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
Old?!  Come look at this!  She has wounds.  Wounds on her head.  Like thrashes.  Or bites.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
But what is the truth?
Well, look here!
The title won't do.
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
Most interesting.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
A woman of property?
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
She is always Aphrodite.
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
I did not.
Cut round him for now.
We are lost.
No, it will turn out well.
Burbage says you have a play.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Good title.
Well, there's a pirate  In truth, I have not written a word.
Ethel.
"Out."
I liked the dog, for laughs.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
Verona again.
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
And I love poetry above all.
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
"Madam!"
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
"Ay me."
But the plague
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I know how to fight!
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
No. I have spoken to the Queen.  Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
A man, my lord?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
You are on my ground.
Serve.
Will you shut up and play.
He's still here.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
I don't know.
What's all this for, more security?
What's wrong?
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Cover it?
I don't know them.
Did you know --
Alex.
It was you, Juliet, it was you --
What I am.
His car's still there.
I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
Now?
Did what?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Unfeasible.
I thought we all were.
Stop nagging.
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
Hello. Hello.
He can't stay up there.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
Expecting anyone?
Aren't you going to answer it?
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
You're frightened.
You'll wait in the hall?
Don't you ever stop?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Two hundred.
What?
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
What guy that died?
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
A little bit. Is that good or bad?
Yes.
I suppose so.
Sorry?
That kid... the hairdresser.
I just thought you'd like to know --
What're you looking for?
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
She's got a...
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
I gotta talk to you.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
But aren't you...
Oh, no.
Yeah.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Why?
Don't make conversation with me.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Then what do you think?
Right now?
What sort of references do you have?
I've got heads here, Norman.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
So how's Norman?
Jesus...
I'm sure.
You don't seem very sure.
Great.
What's wrong?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
What?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- this guy with Jill.
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
You were great.
He still having parties?
Mmmm --
-- yes, you --
-- Jesus --
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
There were some shots.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Now, George --
How are you, baby?
What about me?
I am?
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
When is that?
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
-- well aren't you --
How many?
What difference does it make?
That's all you've got to say?
You need a cut.
But Mr. Norman said --
It's an unusual trade.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
Thank you.
You're right.
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
I don't know what to...
Yeah.  How long have you been here?
Sit down.
Did they have something against me?
Want a drink?
Have a drink.
I know.
Who?
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.

Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A soap?
And?
I was too old.
Yes.
Steve?
You and your touchy investors.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Fine.
Who is that?
Well, what is it, honey?
It must be something.
We don't think marriage is important.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
Egypt?
Why don't you ask for another one?
Sort of.
Well... sure...
I don't think so.
-- why?
No... how long did you say?
Are you married?
No.
No!
Are you sure?
I'm not supposed to.
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Danny?
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
No.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Yes, sir.
She eh... interferes.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
No, we don't mind.
Bill, how do you do?
Well, something'll come.  It's just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
Okay.  I understand.  I'll come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you'll let me read something then.
or whether you don't hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when I am in here that means that I am working - that means don't come in.  Now do you think you can handle that?
Yes, I did.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
Jack!
Stay away from me,
Go away.
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
Hi.
Bill, would you have the Torrances' things brought in their apartment.
Lowe's car-?
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
Don't you touch me, snotbrains!
There's something else scary.
Well, it's probably nothing. I'm just spooked since... you know.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
Well... was it a prescription?
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
Were you tempted?
And I'm tearful!
Excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  At Sunday School?
Mary Robert, don't panic.  Remember what we talked about?  Experience?
You are so damn sexy.
What? 
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
Thanks.  A lot.
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
This prom is a real drag.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Where did that come from?
Mary Clarence.  Goose.  We're completely self-supporting.  Like all convents. Like yours.
It's true -- I know her.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Wet behind the ears.
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
We need experience.
Initiation.  You understand.  Later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
What?
Are you leaving us?
It's true!
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
But look at rites  Look at this!  I'm a nun!  I'm invisible!  I'm a penguin!
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
Girls, this is Sister Mary Clarence. She'll be minding you until Sister Mary Patrick's return.  Mary Clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  Do not attempt discussion.  Am I understood?
It never solves anything.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
Out of the question.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
Really?  And maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
Yeah, like what?  Quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  Lottery tickets?  A travel iron?
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
He didn't do you a favor.
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Okay, here's what I want.  I know about this stuff.  A five-star hotel.  With room service.
Eddie!  You scared the hell out of me!
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I am?
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Oh-huh.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.
Joey?
She's gettin' away!
You didn't shoot!
Mary Clarence!  Sister!
Not a note.
Reverend Mother?
Yes?
But, Bishop...
Soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
If we could speak alone.
We haven't heard your name yet, friend.
The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ?  Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter.
No clotting or gathering of pus.  No healing at all.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
Our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.
Very few, if any.
Just so.  Granted.  And so you take your experimentations to Sleepy Hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place.  Bring him here to face our good justice. Will you do this for me?
I shall, gladly.
Master Crane, sir.  I'm glad we have time alone.  You've been told plenty about the Horseman, I'm certain.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead.
I manage fine alone.
How could he?
It's spectacular.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Must be some sort of gateway.  But, why this place... ?
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
These scars.  How did you get them?
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
Blood.
Why is it every grave I open holds a new mystery inside?
What... what are you doing... ?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
Ichabod...
Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here.
I know you saw me.
What did you say?
You are from the Hollow?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Can you help?
Father saw you die.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah, that's a goodun. I believe you did tell me that one before. I've heard that a bunch. Long time ago.
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
I don't reckon.
All right then.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Thank ye.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
Well, I've got a roomful of work for him to do. Can't get Scooter to do any of it.
How are you, Bill?
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Well, it's on! We're gonna rock. Linda, call Vaughan. Tell him to get over here. I'd like him to be here. I owe him a good time.
You know what I told you, you even think of leavin' me, I'll kill you dead as a doornail.
I ain't sure.
Come on, Karl, let's go out to the garage.
Sure, I guess.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I don't really understand the meaning of the words.
Childers.
Do you like to play football?
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
How do you know?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
Yeah, I did.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Naw.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
I had one there for little bit. Hit didn't get old enough to play with.
I heared it cryin' a little through that box.
I'll play ball with ye. I reckon if neither one of us is no count it won't make no difference.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
Oh, that's Karl. I met him at the laundrymat. Karl, this is my mama. And Vaughan, Vaughan's the manager. He lets mama off any time she feels like it 'cause they're best friends.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
A blister shore can hurt.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I didn't aim to.
Just whenever you take a notion to. I don't aim to put you out.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I's horned and raised here up till I's twelve year old.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Naw, I ain't.
How long have you been standing here?
Okay, Karl, the reason I brought you here was to talk to you about something that is on my mind.  I guess I'll put it right out on the table. Where do I start. Linda and Frank are very important to me. They're like family. My own family was never like family. They're horrible people. As a matter of fact I prayed every night for years that my father would die. I finally realized through a lot of therapy that I was wasting my energy on hating him. Now I just don't care.  You see, you and I are a lot alike, strange as that may seem. I mean not physically or even mentally really, just well, maybe emotionally or actually the hand we've been dealt in life. We're different. People see us as being different anyway. You're -- well you have your affliction or whatever and I, well mine's not as easy to see. I'm just going to say it. I'm gay.  Does that surprise you?  That I'm gay. You know what being gay is, don't you?
Homosexual. I like men. Sexually.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
What about you, Karl? Do you want to stay here?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Let's just go, Marsha.
No, we have to get this story.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Yes.
And what are you, his chaperone?
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Are you closed?
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
It's kind of overwhelming.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
You usually get two.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Once, about three or four months later. I felt so bad about stealing the camera, I hadn't even used it yet. I finally made up my mind to return it, but Granny Ethel wasn't there anymore. Someone else had moved into the apartment, and he couldn't tell me where she was.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up.  I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Not if you got her into one of those rehab programs.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
Good, Auggie. Real good.  All finished.
That's how it is with sidewalks. People come, people go, and they all drop shit on the ground. As soon as you clean up one spot and move on to the next, the first spot is dirty again.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
You mean Rashid?
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
You mean she just ran off with him and left her little boy behind?
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
I don't know what you look like, boy. As far as I can tell, you sprouted up like a mushroom in this spot last night.  You live in this town -- or on your way from here to there?
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
What's your offer?
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
Benefits?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Yeah? Who is it?
Watch out, man. You'll get yourself killed like that.
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
This is the first house I've been in without a TV.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
He's dead?
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Hey, it's you.
Where did you get that thing?
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
Okay, just a little hint. I can't tell you the story, but I'll tell you what gave me the idea for it.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
It wasn't my fault.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
How do you want that cooked?
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
Why?  If they could never take title.
A thousand.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Well, what if?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Closer to eight.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
They were Japanese-American boys, yes sir.
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
<u>Everything</u> had to happen <u>just</u> right.  For your little story to fly.  I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a <u>lot</u> of reasons.
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Still and all.  Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Cigarette?
What for, Sheriff?
So every time you think about showing that jury strength.  Or honor or composure.  Or dignity.
You want me to say that.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
And yet you started the engine right up.  With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  Did that strike you odd?
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Are these your bags?
Aren't you a little too young for that, sonny?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
You're welcome.
Upsy-daisy.
Okay. 
Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.  Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
Me and Tiny, we had them cornered - but we lost 'em in the shuffle.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
No we're not.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
Quiet - I'm thinking.
Nellie told us about it.
It's a hundred miles, Joe - it's snowing - how are we going to get there?
You going to call the police?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
This way, Daphne.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
You - you -
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Wise guy, huh?  Trying to louse me up -
That's right.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
I tell you, Joe, they're on to us.  They're going to line us up against the wall and -  Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh - and then the police are going to find two dead dames, and they're going to take us to the ladies' morgue, and when they undress us - I tell you, Joe, I'm just going to die of shame.
Shut up and keep packing.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
OH!
She sings, too.
Are my seams straight?
And that's one of them.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
That's ridiculous.
And you've got cold feet.
I may spill something.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
I'm a what?
Well, I'll come back later.
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
How did you get that bracelet?
Help yourself.
You don't say.
You invest in shows?
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Why?
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Daphne...
Pleased to meet you.
I forgive you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
Now look, Nellie - if it's about last Saturday night - I can explain everything.
We'll take it!
We got time off for good behavior.
Tell what?
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Saxophone player?
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
I don't think so.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
How's the stock market?
Oh.  Well, I guess some like it hot.  But personally, I prefer classical music.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
I thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It looked so small from the beach - but when you're on it, it's more like a cruiser - or a destroyer.
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Where's your shell collection?
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Really?
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
You're not?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Where did they play it - in a garage on Clark Street?
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
Refresh my memory.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Where’s Nick sleeping?
Huh?
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  And Amy wasn’t just jealous...she was sad and lonely. She missed you.
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Nothing.
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Not for a dog.
Hi. Hey.
Mmm.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Oh, no.
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
You don't live around here, do you?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
That does it...
What about Sounder?
What do I tell my mama when I get home? I didn't find him and that's what I wanted to do.
Nothin'...
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
It's cold, Daddy!
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
Where was you, Daddy?
Into the clouds and behind the mountains.
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
What's that you carryin'?
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
I'll find out where your daddy is for you.
Tired.
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
I just got out here!
Where you goin'!?
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!
Patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
Doggy.
Pillow.
Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!
How come Terrance and Phillip are so weird looking?
I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Come on, just get to the message board!
Bingo. Okay, here we go...  Want to help Terrance and Phillip? Meet us for a meeting at Gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Mph rmprmmh rm!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Wendy, Mkay, if you want to start getting political, I'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. Mkay?
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
We can't, we're on a hunger strike.
Boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
What's that?
YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!
Uhh... I don't know.
Guess.
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!
<b>Thank my lucky stars Here before me now Is everything I'd ever hoped for Knew it in a word Saw it in a glance The only thing I think I'd die for...</b>
Nowhere.
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
What about air strikes?
We have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  It's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach American soil!
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
You're all part of Satan's army now!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Well, Terrance I hope you learned something from this whole experience.
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
AGH!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You know I do.
Do you remember when you first got here? We used to talk all night long. Until the sun came up... We would just lie in bed and TALK.
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
What the hell are you talking about, kid?
NAZIS!!
You didn't?
You don't have watches?
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh yeah...
It can't be.
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Well, so we are.  Sure is beautiful, huh?
And what are they doing now, Mac?
It's a little late for you to be up.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
I think I can handle it.
You better start making sense!
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
That's clear.
Look at this...Jesus.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
Take this flare.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
I'm going back for Taylor!
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.
Is it safe for human transport?
My father used to say to me "Never..." no, hmmm. "Always..." No, no...  Ah! Love and hate are blood relations.
The pin machine?
Whoa, cool your maples. Over the bridge, past the Peter Pan, last house on the dead end. Theo releases Sid's hand. Sid drops to his knees and cradles his damaged hand.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Look, Faz, Mr. Kastle was not his usual charismatic self today when he told us to tell you...  What was that he said...?
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
No kiddin'.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
Theo.
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
The small ball.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
Look, kid, gimme a break. I'm an old man.  I'm runnin' on a Delrin aorta. I'm finished - dead from my ankles up.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Don't tell me, John.
Nobody touches her. Except me. I touch her. Sheila told me you played bouncy- bouncy with her.
Come on Sheila, knock-knock.
Junior who?
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Where's Junior?
I bet you didn't know that you and Junior have something in common, Theo: Junior can't bowl anymore either. Isn't that right Junior? Kastle SLAMS the ketchup bottle down on Junior's right hand. The table settings jump from the shock. Junior sits impassively, his face a blank.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
Hello, Mr.Kastle.
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
What does he do?
No. Do You?
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
You told Junior that we did it.
We would have sooner or later.
Are you sure he's dead?
Can I come with you?
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Very professional.
I'm not here to bowl.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
But she's --
What was that?
Captain.
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
Or maybe, it can't <u>be</u> killed.
I don't know.  That's the point.
But sir --
She should've known better.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
It's not sucking, sir.
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
She's not gonna know.
A half a mile long?
They switched us over.
I want a name.  A real name.  This thing's full name, rank and serial number.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
Resetting the sub.
You're next, Norman.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Norman.
So what?
Don't do this.
Don't bother me, Norman.
You, me and Harry?
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
You should know how it works.  Just in case.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you?
A synthetic opium analogue.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Causes sleep.
Beth --
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
How do you feel about snakes?
He can't manifest.
Someone did.
I never went in that sphere.
I promise --
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Where is it coming from, Beth?
C'mon --
What is that?  What are you doing?
What?
Beth --
No.  I don't think so.
Well, what's your theory?
For who?  The fish?
Then what is it?
They're going to want answers and they're going to keep asking until they get them.
We can refuse to talk.
No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
What?
Don't be defensive.
Our answer.
I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report?
No.  I didn't say that.
What happens on page 87?  Have you ever read page 87?
She's cracking, Norman.
But why would she -- ?
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
She told me what you said, Norman.
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
Meaning?
Does this mean what I think it means?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
What report?
Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight.
Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
The creature?
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
Has Harry spoken with Jerry?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
I don't know.
We're going to get in by studying Imperial procedures?  I don't like it.
Is that good or bad?
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm Luke Starkiller, guardian of the Bendu.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
They use the Bogan Force.
Are you sure you don't need it?
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
What about the princess?
Of course, where you been kid?
I'll tell you, Luke, and this is between you and me.  The star force isn't all it's cracked up to be. Frankly, it's a bore, and it's going to stay that way as long as this system is neutral...
Have you been checked out?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
I don't see how we're going to find anything out here.  This terrain is hopeless.
Why didn't you say so before.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
Are you there, sir?  We're going...
Thank you, sir.  Your kindness is greatly appreciated, but if it's at all possible, Artoo and I would like to remain in your service.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Mobile Infantery rules !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
I don't believe it !
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Assistant insructor... You must be some kind of a hot stick. Should I call you "sir" ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
I want to be part of the best flight team in the Fleet...
Funny...
I don't want everyone to see.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I love you, Carmen.
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose...?
You're late.
Shhhh...!
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
I bought the farm, didn't I, Johnny ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
Fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... They'd like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
You're standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !
We're outa here. Lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. This real estate's about to go buggy.
How bad are you, pal ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
What is it, Rico ?
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
<U>Why</U>...?!
'To learn all that is learnable.'
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
I advise caution, Captain; we can't withstand another attack.
Captain, what's the next move?
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
Capture God! In order to retrieve V'ger's data, the Creator has to physically come here!...
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
I still contain fragments of my human half.
And whatever you sensed out here....
The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor...  ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
And these 'sensor-swarms' collect that data, carry it here.
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
The point... 
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
Dock control reports ready, sir.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
Well, it had sentimental value.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
You haven't heard of it.
Yes.
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
Everyday things...yes.
You're still here.
That's why you didn't want to take the <u>Mill</u> out...you've...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
What happened?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
What are you doing down there?
"Room Service!"
Would you put on your cl...  Just leave it outside.
Do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
Yes.
It used to be the Old Mill.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
She <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. Was her...
...yes.
Pelting down out there.
What am I gonna do?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Look at this.  Do you know what they're offering?  Look at this.  They treat us like we're their backyard.  Do you know what they're offering for three days to close down Main Street?
That's so beautiful...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We had a date.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
What courthouse?
Town ain't got no courthouse.
It'll hurt the box office.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested... the "dead horse scene," the...
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
Yeah, but they never made a movie here.
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
What is that in fingers...?  Just kidding, get me this horse.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
You can go...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Who is that...?
We're just talking about the...
Yes, yes, but...
<u>Forget</u> the contract.  Claire.  What is it?
We, we have to give it.
An artist of your caliber...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in the World Court.  Did she like the costumes?
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
How about that.
I had a witness I would.
I just saw the Mayor, he said anything we...
You want me to lie.
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
The girl was in the car.
Then you're finished in show business.
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
My oh my.
Find the money.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
I've got two days to get this house...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
I want them thrown in jail.
Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half an hour, get across the street yesterday.
He's going to <u>get</u> that calf.
I hate when you say that.
Like who?
It happens.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
What's Thursd...
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Here's <u>weak</u>...Mom said she was gonna talk to the <u>teacher</u> and Brad's <u>parents</u>!!  Can you <u>believe</u> the <u>humiliation</u>???

Rachel's job is she works.
Rache says I have to eat <u>lamb</u>.  I told her <u>you're</u> making me <u>spaghetti</u>!
That's Rache's song!
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
Right here.  Right here.  <u>Inside</u> the magician.  Shhhh.
You've got a fruit loop in your hair.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Because you don't really seem here.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
I have a snoop.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Look, you've never liked me...
Did I hear the word...
Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob...
How the hell would you know?
I don't, but...
You're a cross-dresser.
And you said...?
I really look like shit.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Looks nice enough to m...
That's not wh...
Oh please.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
I just found out I have to go to Boston to get a deposition.  I might not be back until Saturday.
Get ready.  To get <u>really</u> mad.
I think so...What do you think?
Rache, it may take time.
What a great surpri...
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.
Can we go sit somewhere?
That's a pretty ugly thing you just said.
You heard me: leave the table!
Like what?
I'll be your guest!
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
We had to work. My family was poor.
Must've been hard being poor.
Yes, you are. I can tell. What's the matter?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
No, you don't.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
Nothing, I guess…
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Marty...
Look, we're not suckers. Everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
Well, I sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
Thank you.  So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Say, 'Nigger.'
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
I hate reading.
OK.
Who is this?
But...you called.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
I do.
Yeah.
How many?
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
What is most important to you?
Th-they want t-twenty-f-five million dollars cash--or Chemco will be destroyed.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Well get someone down there!
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
Now what?
That's it!  Up ahead!
Came over the satellite.  We're keeping the bird clear should they call back.
Who's Ryan Cooper?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Why should I worry?  Is there a problem?
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
Please be calm, Ambassador De Sade.
Where is this...thing?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
I think that just might be it!  Although it could be Riki-Tiki-Tavi.
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Colonel, don't you know what's going on?
You must think I'm an awful sap, Major.  Just sit down, fella, and keep your hands on the desk!
On your feet, fella.  I've got to get outside and see how my men are.
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Well, Mister President.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
How much soda, sir.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
But if they suddenly opened up and gave us the inspection we want, we'd agree, wouldn't we?
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
Yeah, I got it in the thigh.
They can't touch us at this height.
Well, listen, King.  Could you take her up to about eight hundred?  That'll help you come in at a nice down-angle, and it'll give us a chance for our chutes to open.
Okay.  Check these points.  Complete radio silence.  To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits.  The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Release first safety.
Yes, Major.
He's dead, all right.
Recall what mistake?
What do you mean?
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
Come on, King.  That doesn't make sense.
I'm okay.  What's up?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
But who would be chosen?
Mn-hm.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Typical male.
What's it about?
Don't let 'em fight.
That's the rock star thing.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
A long, long, long, long, while.
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Yeah.
Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
No.
Wait. Hey, man.
Buff...
She's dead.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Oh, how did you get burnt-out?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
Score! Yeah!
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
Thanks. See man?
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Come on. Inside.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
Hi.
Hi.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Erica.
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Um, mother-daughter.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
What'd you do?
Yes.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Hey, w-why don't you see if he's hiring, you know? Get an application?
Is that Bee-Bee?
I don't know.
That's right.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
God, I haven't seen you all day.
It's a piece.
About what?
Of course I do!
Your completely missing the point.
Oh, yeah?
I would've stopped it.
Nothing.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No. No, no, no.
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
Oh, yeah?
To his hotel?
Oh, no, no, no.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. I mean, it's dumb, I know, it's just...
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
What?
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh...
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
I don't know.
What about this, huh? Go ahead, big man.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Yeah.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
If...
No, I'm going.
Me?
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Tim?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
About what?
It's none of my business?
Why don't you go back to where you came from?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Wait!  Did you say you are pregnant or you were pregnant... You had it, threw it out and you're gonna go back and dance all night!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Diane?  Diane!
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
You sure?
Jack...
Jack, I think I should get a job.
Anyway, last time I checked, you still had to have sex to have an orgasm.  And I know she ain't seen the lord on all fours - so I'm just saying.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Shit!  Yeah, Grandma.  Me and the squad.
I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
My what?
Give me your coat.
It's from hunger.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
I had a teacher like that once.
As for instance?
Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Into what? A lampshade?
If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot.
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town.
Good.
I'm sorry.  I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Nice job.
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
Whose?
Why did she call me?
All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
It is not.  Get out.
Or shall I call my servant?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
This is fascinating.
I wrote that with my heart.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
Where do you live?
I'm used to paying my own bills.
What's wrong with It?
I don't need any clothes, and I certainly don't want you buy- ing them for --
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
How did it go?
Good night.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
Wanted what?
You are not dressed properly.
Good.
How come?
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
What's the matter, Max?
Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
Oh, fiddlesticks. What could be dangerous about a baseball game?
Why did she have to show up now?
Eliminate her.
What do I do?  I don't know her name.
Home?
Western Europe.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Yes. It reminds me of home.
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Why not ?
She said it wouldn't last.
Away. From you.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
That's the Power Source that was lost from Argo City! That's what I came: to find! Where does she live?
How do I fight it?
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
I have a lot of repeat business. People seem to like my service.
Oh no, not you again.
This "love" of yours will soon wear off. I gave you a temporary love potion.
Why should I believe you?
No!
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Did anybody notice you?
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I am almost an adult. This is what I want.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
There isn't any.
My cousin Clark is my only relative on Earth.
How'd you do that?
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Where is inner space?
It's lovely. . .
You're going to take me back?
Goodbye...
What?
Roebush! That's  the guy! Buddy, he's gonna nail our behinds to the wall! this is Special Order! He said he had to have it before...  Omigod!! What's tomorrow?
The kid needs a man to show him --
You'd be surprised how many offers I didn't get. Even Brad wouldn't stick around for this.  It really isn't easy.
Who?
You thought that?
Peanut butter and jelly.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Do you really know Superman?
It's practically an American ritual, Mr. White! Isn't that so, Jimmy?
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
What about this week's check?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
Columbia.
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
Gus, if there's anything I hate, it's greed.
Fair's fair.
Stone mutha.
I ain't about to argue with you.  What's gonna happen to them three? Ross the boss and those ladies?
No, we're just going down.
We gonna crash?
We back in Metropolis?
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Lois, I've got to hand it to you. You're amazing. Who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that's going to blow the lid off government corruption in the Caribbean?
You! Activate circuits 29 through W7 and start Full Power Coordinates on Exterior Defensive Systems:
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Computers talk to other computers, right?
Someplace where nobody knows him so they can't connect him with us.
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
What's wrong?
Where did it come from?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I don't?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Hi.
I'll try to remember that . . .
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
A parka.
Genius!  --  Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
Where?
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
What do you want?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Free!
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
He's a jerk. I never noticed it before. Seems like a lot of people I know are jerks . . .  . . . Maybe you think the same thing about me. That's why you keep avoiding me.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
No Paris?
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
Boys, old Lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. You help me place it on one of your missiles and I promise you . . . if Superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. I'll be able to introduce Superman to his first nightmare . . . a Nuclear Man!
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
And what do we get out of it?
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
What's that?
Ready, Uncle Lex?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
I hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. I am a ...
Nobody else.
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
Well, how are you enjoying your first day on the job?
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Not unless you can fly.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
What'd you call him?
You're not the only one.
You and your real estate.
See?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Will you abide by the Council's opinion?
The good lord works in mysterious ways.
-- as we will be.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
I guess I got carried away
Oh.
How much do you weigh?
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
What color underwear am I wearing?
I...uh...
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
But, to someone from the planet Krypton, this substance would be lethal because of its high level of radioactivity. Kryptonite! Ah, Kryptonite! That's the stuff!
It's just that  --  I spent a fortune on these things!  And all for naught! What a waste  --
You're right, you're right, Superman. There were wrinkles to iron out. But, well...  ...there is this new rocket, the XK 101.
Well, that's their problem, T.S. But  --  but the XK 101 also works on a radio wave control system. The problem was to find out the frequency. Problems, problems, I've had so many...
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
That's where I'm going.  To see her.
They just finished supper.
So what brings you out tonight?
Well, I don't know why it should. There's a whole lot of people in town involved with lawsuits.  We're hardly unique here, Billy.  I mean, I can understand how you feel.
You're leaving.
Good night, Billy.
I have to.
From what?
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
What do you mean?
Did they give him special care?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened.  That's how I remembered it.  But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty.  Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
He knows that?  Billy?
That's what he said, is it?
It's for the school bazaar.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Nicole!
Did he say what about?
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It's like a song.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
I want to sit beside you tomorrow.
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
Yes.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Is there shrimp on it?
Please, let me explain.  I'll only take a moment of your time.
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
No.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
Did you say anything to Mrs. Driscoll?
What's that?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
What's going to happen to Dolores?
I don't know.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
There's talk of that.
Alone or surrounded?
Did she accept?
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
You hear that, Susie...  Continue please...
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Who said Sidney?
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
Awright, that brings us up to five weeks ago. "Sidney, I got a nasty little problem here." Did I say no? I'm frank to admit - it don't jell as fast as we like... But all of a sudden I CAN'T GET YOU ON THE PHONE NO MORE!  WHY?... And why, as of this date, am I frozen out of the column...
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Well, what have I got?  Alimony to a pair of tramps?  They're of no concern to me.  It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
I got that boy coming over here.  What's so funny?
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
He goes out with girls.
Bribing me again?
Staring.  Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
Nothing I didn't think of you before.
But what?
Who else phoned?
The renting agent and the tailor.
Take a top coat.
What's the matter?
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Where do you come off to make a remark like that?
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
Darling, I don't care - really I don't.  Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
Those lying motherfuckers!
Where we going?
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
TERMINATED!?  Shit!  Why didn't you tell me? We gotta right now!
What?
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Excellent.
You don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
I'll deal with the police.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
Out of the way, John!
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
Can it be destroyed?
The man most directly responsible is Miles Bennet Dyson, Director of Special Projects at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
On all what?
When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him, was he pleased?
'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
So, what does the Russki want?
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
What's that mean?
You have a question for Helmuth, David?
Can I ask you a favour, Major?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
Colonel. Pleasure.
A great artist will have great privileges in a Russian zone.
Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
I have a duty.
Mine's the Eleventh.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
Major, Major... he's here ...
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
How come?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
Then you are wrong.
That's an outrageous lie!
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
Do you know what that is?
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
All in the cause of humanity, Helmuth. Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one?
Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday.
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is?
First oboe.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
I hate the beige one.
And you're from the future too?
Reese...you got a first name?
Well, at least I know what to name him.  I don't suppose you'd know who the father is? So I don't tell him to get lost when I meet him.
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Hot dogs?
He'll find us, won't he?
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
Kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
Send a unit.
I just called.
Projections were far too optimistic.
The stock will turn.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
What's C.R.S.?
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Never did catch your name.
We hang down here and drop.  The garbage'll break our fall.
I know the owner of Campton Place.  I could talk to him in the morning.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What is this!?
Get out.
It wasn't his fault.  He thought it was his only way back.  They fleeced him real good.
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
Where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
Nicholas, this is fake.  It's all part of the game...
Bullshit.  They killed him. Feingold, Fisher, whoever... they shot him...
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
Shut up!
No...
Is this something you're interested in?  I'm not really that person I was.
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Studied acting, I assume?
Hey there, Nickie.
I redecorated.  What about you?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
This isn't an escort service?
Are you still on mediction?
I'll call them, okay?
I'm going to call.
What have they been doing to you?
It's them.  They did this.
How did those... ?
You're behind this, aren't you?  You and your sick friends.  Well, make it stop!
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Yeah.
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
Well, where to begin.  It's complicated...
Have you gone to the police?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
No, thank you.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
Humor me with specifics.
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
Get rid of them.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
It was a different floor then...
The key?
Sometimes I wonder how much of him there is in me.
What's the trouble?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Invitations: the Museum Gala.
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
I wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  It's obviously some sort of prank...
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
Why are you following me?
Hey... !
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
You're joking.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
What?
Hi, Luke Sanderson, bad sleeper, I'm your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
The children.  The children Hugh Crain built the house for.  The children he never had.
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Nell --
Was sure she'd be in here.
No, Malcolm!  Individual performance is only part of it.  I know why baseball players choke for no reason, I know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what I want to know is, how fear works in a group...
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
No.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
All the carvings.
Welcome Home.
He's wandering around the house, and Nell heard him.  She thought it was ghosts.  Let's go look for him again.
Why?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Wait.  You're not wearing that ironically?  This is really you?
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Yes.  I've missed it.
Well, it wasn't me.  Mister Dudley had to clean it and he knows that he's in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  You said the Good Doctor was with you.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Adhara.  I told your father, if you're looking for a name, you can't go wrong with a constellation.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
That's what Gordon's always saying.
What's the matter?
When you find the guy, you'll know.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Oh really?  Where you from?
Lookin' good.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
He don't have a concealed weapons permit.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
What?
You goin' back inside?
Do you have any friends, man?
What post office?
Not no more, they ain't.  I quit that acting shit, man.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
You look alike.
Why did you come here?
How d'you mean?
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
When did you get in?
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Nah, accommodation address.
I'll bloody well ask him.
Tell us about it.
A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- <u>after</u> we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up --  in increments.
You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
You sure?
Sounds like you need a rest.
The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
Makin' trouble for someone?
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
Something's on.
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
He's expecting you?
Hello there.
You've made it ... brighter.
Hello, Rachel.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Boy.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
Ah... it's nothing.
...You are ze fahzer?
Uh--
No. I--tell me--
And how do we share--
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Uh-huh.
$10,000! I don't know what to do, Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. Even though I know who the sonofabitch is.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Big Dave--
...Hell, I hope I've done the right thing.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
It was Big Dave's.
I don't know. I don't think so.
Yeah.
Yeah. What do I, uh...
...Huh?
Yeah--
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Could you come with me please?
Ah.
Second chair.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
Beauregard!  You scared me half to death.
Someone broke into this room.
Why not?
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
If the party goes forward, and that's a big if... I've arranged for a large police presence.
Fifteen... what's next?
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
We need light in here, stat.
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
I've got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
Pendergast!  Help!  It's right behind us!
I smell it.  It's here.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
I can't help thinking there's something that Pendergast overlooked.  If the scratches were made by whatever killed Beauregard, it wants something that's in here.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Dr. Frock?
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
How many storage areas are there?
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
They've got something.
Come on.  Let's get back to the others.  We can't leave them alone.
Oh no.  I smell it.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
I don't understand.
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't understand.
Where did you see it?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
All right.  This is hard for me.  I'm a scientist.  I like order and logic. Sometimes too much.  There's got to be an explanation.  There can't be an animal in there.  But I saw something.
What was it?
Gone.
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
What is it doing?
No.  It's still hunting, but not for the hormones.
For what?
We have to try and draw it off!
What?
Why wouldn't I?
I thought you were in a hurry.
He doesn't care.
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
--a dead one at that.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
A window onto the human condition?
People forget it takes the <i>population</i> of an entire country to keep the show running.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
The memory of who?
Why not?
No?  Really?  Good, I mean, I thought possibly a pizza.  How about Friday?
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
Stay where you are!
Every time you and Marlon--
What're you doing down here?
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
They never found Dad's body--maybe somehow--
--Darling--
I'm looking for my wife--Nurse Burbank. It's important.
Who?
Good.  Good.
Do you live around here?
You've got something to show me.
Who called this meeting?
What's that?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Those people were already dead.
And are you familiar with FEMA? What the Federal Emergency Management Agency's real power is? FEMA allows the White House to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. To create a non-elected government. Think about that.  What is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban Texas?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
A plague?
What?
You didn't know my father --
I know that. But the threat was called in for the Federal Building across the street.
No you didn't.
Scully?
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
What are you implying, Scully?
Mulder -- what are you doing?
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What are my choices?
What?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
It may be extraterrestrial.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
You hear that?
Scully....?
You can't quit, Scully.
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
We're going to the morgue.
I don't know anything about that.
Well, call General McAddie.
About what?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
You're lying.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
What do you mean, walked?
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
Where is he?
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
What alien environment?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
Almost.  Mocky-Lock showed up.
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
Good.  We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
Yes mother.
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
I did, yeah.
You think you can do this, don't you?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
Already there.
Shouldn't we get a catheter in him?
Nervous?
No.
Is she alright?
Dr. Kent.
What about the cat?
So?
We'll go back to his house, Pete. There's still a lot to do.  Analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  Maybe he owns property somewhere.
What else do we do?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Ja, ja, ja.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.
...at all.
What's that?
Oh, that was many years ago.
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
That's his headache.
In one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called Joseph. He gave you the number of the Casanova Club. That is where a lot of friends of Lime used to go.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
I don't know.
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Where?
What is it?
Yes.
Must have known I was broke. Even sent me an airplane ticket. It's a shame.
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
I suppose you don't believe me.
I said you win.
Be sensible, Martins.
I'll look it up for you.
Mr. Holly Martins, sir.
Who?
Hello, Harry.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
I want to talk to you.
Hmm.
Mr. Martins. Delighted to meet you. Come let's sit down here. Ober! Zwei. What would you like. Tea? Coffee?
Not yet.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Martins.
...he was. Yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
In great pain?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
I was told that he did not die at once.
Kurtz.
Something wrong.
That's all you meant?
Wasn't he at the police inquiry?
What else did he tell you?
Joseph Harbin.
...this time.
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Excuse me.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
What are you doing in Thailand? Tourist?
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I don't think so.
Nice work.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
I don't know - I'm American.
We're ok.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
She is gone!
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So?
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
What??
I don't, but...
You will.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
What's he care about?
Who's Linda?
Oh, yeah... 
They think it's the word of God, and it's holy, and the flesh isn't....
It's silent. It holds a place, takes a vowel. The vowels are little dots that go under the letters.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
And belief follows?
You shouldn't.
You gotta get out of here.
Yeah, I remember.... Kill any Jews yet?
That's a much easier game.
They're liars and cowards.
Is it okay if I record this?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
And? WHat did you notice?
So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt.
Are all Jews the same?
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
To discredit me. Because I know who they are. Look, I thought I explained it to you. Those people can say or do anything. And they will. It's all narrative to them, it's... Are you going to print what this guy said?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
How did you get the fucking number?
I don't do that.
Lina... It's happening. Tonight.
Do you know them?  I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and --
Hello...?
What is it?
Shut up. Fuck you....
Who even knew?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
Why me?
How?
Dennis Leary.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Do you think I...
...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming....
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
The documents are forged.
No!
It can't be true!
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
You're right.  You're fired.
He seems to have won it.
In a lake.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Well, good night, then...
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
You risk your life when you cross the street.
The company asked me to extract everything I could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, I fucked up!  Can you help?
The medics are looking all over for you.
Where did you get that?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
You still collect them?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
No!  I would never cheat you.
How do you know that?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
It's his heartbeat.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Will he understand Spanish?
Alright Mordechai, now that we're alone I just want to say that I'm not happy about this. I don't want a repeat of that incident in the West Bank.
What's up?
So why the long face?
Any sign of Santa?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
Yes Esther.
Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
...and their children will all be able to eat latkes and spin dreidels, and light the menorah with the knowl...
I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
What's wrong with him?
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
A stereo type alarm system?
Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah.
What are you doing?
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
So, how was I?
Well, he's kinda just resting in the corner with his girlfriend.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
I don't know. I want to see Robles.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Cut.
Something black —- something on its way to you ——
The death card - -
Well, I'd best be off.
There is no danger at all. It's a wild animal. Do you think a wild animal prefers walls, streets and people when it can get into open country?
Why?
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
Come to look around?
Some crazy guy.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
You must admit it's possible that it might have been a man.
It's better you don't know.
That was unfortunate.
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Go on foot.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
I don't know —— a witness. He seemed to know something about animals -- you know -- expert testimony.
Yeah.
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Half to the Delgado family and half to Clo-Clo's family.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Will you please come with me?
That might depend on where you’re going.
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
I found this at your brother’s.
Laurence!
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Mr Lombard...
I’m really sorry you were not called...
How... When did you...
My brother hung himself.
Adonis thought your brother’s body’d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn’t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon’s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon’s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I’d exceeded his expectations.
Good.
Where is that?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Get to the point, will you...
Why the hell couldn’t you divorce the man?
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
I know where to look.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Yeah.
So, what are you looking for?
What about an untrained pup, white...
I’m afraid the only pups currently available at such notice are brown and trained. But they are all very cheerful and have been thoroughly checked for diseases...
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
...On holiday?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What?
And who does Friedman work for?
No.
La what?
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
What if it is?
Must I speak to you in French?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
You seem very sure about that.
What is it?
What are you talking about?
I’ll be alone.
Evening. Table for one?
Leon? No. I’m afraid he left.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
A private investigator... You’re not Austrian?
Can I get up now?
He just said he had good reasons.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
... No.
Welcome to the club.
Oh. That’d be Rhian, a Welsh chick he used to lay at weekends. She got wise and dumped him months ago...
Qu’est-ce que tu veux?
We are so alike, Xavier. Still, sometimes I wonder which one of us is the ugliest.
Why did you kill Friedman?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
They lost their son. Why?
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Cost what?
Costliest!
What’s that? A word?
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Good.
Well...
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
To be killed in battle?
I want to stay with you...
I -- I don't understand...
One day you will.
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
And so I... I prefer my banner.
Yes, but...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I don't understand... the holy oil of Clovis... it was quite full the last time I saw it...
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
How old are you?
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
Not long ago...
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it?  Why?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
He's feeling wonderful.
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Your majesty, I really think you...
For what?
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Not yet.
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
Yeah...
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
Who gave you that horse?
Still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl wouldn't you say?
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  Are you God?
I... I never lied!
Why were you yelling like that?!
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I need to confess.
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Oh yes... very.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Good, good.  And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
He never says his name.
Beautiful.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Why did she have to die?
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Hello.
Who are you?
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
What's happened?
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
Who told you?
We use what?
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
Otherwise what?
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
No, I'm a socialist. I have brothers everywhere. They bring me news and food. We care about our fellow human beings. Workers of the world unite.
So, what's the news?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Wladek! How are you?
Cow!
You're a dirty pig!
If I play like an angel, why don't you listen?
Where are you hiding?
Are the Russians here?
We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
No sound at all?
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
My REAL father was a famous German composer
Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra.
Which mountains are those dear?
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
She wants to see what you can do.
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
You've missed this bit.
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
Don't think so.  I know everybody in the place and I always bounce the lamsters.
All right if I look around your lobby?
Who told ya this guy was in here?
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
Jesus, what a bundle.  Did you know he was that loaded?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
How much did ya lose?
Wasn't no problem a mine.
Hey, Luther told me he was carrying a wad, but I didn't figure this much.
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
There's always a depression on.
I like griftin'.
I don't look any good in clothes and I don't know how to drive. What else ya got to sell, Eirie?
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't care.  Load me a deck.  Set it up for threes and nines.  I'll cut it in on his deal.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
I picked something up on the way.
You gotta keep Lonnegan's con, even after you spent his money.  And no matter how much you take from his, he'll get more.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
Looks like he's sulking.
You in?
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Yeh, that'd be real nice of ya, Mr. Lonneman.
Raise 500.
See and raise 1,000.
The name is Lonnegan.
Who are you?
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
My end was only one.
Then I'm afraid we'll have to impound your money until we're sure that it's all good.  Can I see your wallet and your ticket, please?
You done?
Where's June today?
2:00 A.M.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
I feel lucky tonight.
Your boss is quite a card player, Carver.  How does he do it?
You should always look to the back too, kid.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
What happened to your face?
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
Will you wait until the chump is played?
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
We missed him.
You weren't hired to miss him.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
What's your next step, Nick?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
All settled?  Grand!  Why did your mother ever divorce him?  He's swell.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.
Any luck?
Mind if I look around?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
Your father?
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
She fell down.
Dead?
Forgive me.  How are you?
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Only in bad weather.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Did you kill her?
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
What's he want of you?
Nothing.
What'd he think it was to you?
This gun yours?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
He telephoned me today.
No.
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Who's that man?
What bonds?
Well, let me do that for you.
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
What do you think?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
You might have mentioned me first.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
What are you going to do with it?
Yes.
No thanks.
They were kidding you.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
You're a fine watch dog.
Finished with these?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Sit down!
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Goodbye, darling.
Sure I will.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
How long has he been dead?
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Mimi!
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
Come on out, now.  He won't hurt you.  Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
How did you get in here?
Was he a good detective?
Well, congratulations.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Where were you going?
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
Why, yes, Jaeger.  I believe it is.
There's nothing we can do.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
We are not at war!  You and I and Jaeger are AWOL.  We have no authority--
I've got no stomach for murder.
At-at-at-at-at.  At-at-at-at-at.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
Oh, that's fun.
Wh-what do you think--
They'll shoot us!
...I know.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
Faster we get there, faster we get back.
What!?
My leg is falling asleep.
You're going to be fine.
You're not losing trust, are you?
What are you doing?
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We can't just leave him.
We'll lie.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
It's all right.  I don't like it, but it's over now.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
Is that good, or bad?
With what?  Against how many?
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
Thanks.
That shouldn't be too hard to read.  Iraq is the pink thing.
Planning on going to war all by your lonesome?
Yeah, a headache.  My head hurts.  You're making me uncomfortable.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Jaeger?
Yeah.  So?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
It's right here.  This region; an-Nagaf. I got recon photos.  There're no troops there, no fighting--
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Oh, God!
Yeah!  Yeah!
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic.  Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war.  They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs.  They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy.  America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out:  They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert.  They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost.  It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something.  And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis.  See how I mean?
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Drug evasion with assorted perversions
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
You know I don't feel well.
I don't know.
Look,dirt!
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
You don't know.  You don't....
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
Good Lord!
I can just barely see him.  I think he's leaving.
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
Not very encouraging.
What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever....
No...no you're wrong.
Yes
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
Now wait just a fucking-
Only once, at Redstone.
An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
Pittsburgh, two years ago. Partner died, no back-up, I was too gung-ho. As usual.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
Would you?
Talk to me. Let's assess.
Okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
It's from an IRA.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
No... No more killing.
Alex, please.
Son-of-a-bitch... my nose... This fuck-up is interfering with-
Nitro, dash of Semtrex, vegetable oil ...
Oh shit...
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
Reilly, Vice. I-
Vice cop on a homicide?
Got it! Ace Match Company, Flint, Michigan.
Nice to be here.
What's this?
Yes, sir.
I promised her she'd be safe.
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Diamonds all over.
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
What did you talk about?
But you <u>have</u> been in Venice?
You're looking fine, Major.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
And as for you, waiter--
Yes, Baron?
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Two weeks and three days.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
What do you mean?
Thank you, Major. 
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
The tennis player?
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
No, thank you.
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Gaston Monescu.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
What?
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Now, Lily--
You <u>have</u> to get out of here!
Lily, you must listen to me.
And you--
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
Oh!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's too dark.
Make it out to cash!
Right!
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
Ye-es?
Madame.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
Call the police?
<u>Adolph</u>?
Giron...!
Goodbye.
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Oh, M'sieu Laval ...
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to-- 
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Well--uh--yes and no.
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
For all the really important things--
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
I think you'd better go.
Your bag?
No--I'm sorry.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
The ship will sink.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
How you two doin'?
I prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
She had beautiful hands.
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
This is horseshit.
I'm so cold.
Never let go.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
It would be a nice change from you.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
I'll join you later.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
You'll excuse me. 
Where'd you get it?
Aces full.
Could I see you a minute?
I thought you were one of my friends.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
Very--your mother?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
A little.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
You take some awful chances.
Partners, ain't we?
Say--wait a minute!
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
June? That's my wife's name.
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Knots!
That's me!
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Is this your gun?
Am I a member of this club?
Well, let's hear the poem--
Very good, Mary--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
They're a cinch to read--Queen of Clubs--  --Ace of Diamonds. 
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
No!
Why?
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I sincerely hope so--
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
I thought I had our sailing covered up--  --and here it is.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Oh, for Christ's sake!
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
On three?  You call it.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Wyatt.  God, I'm so sorry.
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Not half as bad as I feel.
I don't believe it.  He's clean!
What?  But I saw 'em-
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
Good God, you're really-
You know, we might just pull this off.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
You're a little touchy about it.
What about her?
And I don't even know your full name.
I have to go.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Forget it, Ringo.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
Yeah?
How you doin', boy?
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish...
Get down, boy.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
See what I mean about it getting Spooky?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
I resent your tone, sir. I have men who are missing -
How did you get this number?
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor...  And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Where can I find him?
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Q! How are you?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Just - say it. Say it just once.
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
It must do something.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
I'll keep that in mind.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
- You're not.
Blood or Dutch?
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
You're to wear this mask at the Venice Carnival, and wait to be contacted.
.... I hate to ask, but... Did you ever think you'd miss Communism?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Tsi tien, Mr. Bond.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
What is HE doing here?
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Fueled and waiting.
They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor!
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
Man, act like this is your home.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
Course, it is your business, but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the boy.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Chick was outright killed by a mob. He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him, they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town.
A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days.
Girl, do you still sing and dance?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Did you have your child at home?
What must I do?
What are you doing?
I was just trying to make conversation.
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.
Can I help pump the gas?
Yeah?!
Right here in the van.
Oh, great, you found them.  Where were they?
Hello-o-o...
T-O-Y.  Toy.
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
Don't talk to me about importance. Because of YOU the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
Another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
But -- the hat looked good.  Tell me the hat looked good!  The apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
Andy's house.  Sid's house.  What's the difference.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
Yeah, right.
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Hold on, Woody!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
Hey, watch it!
Ohhh!  You sunk it!
Heh-heh.
Did I get my package in the mail?
I dunno.
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
C'mon, guys!  Every Christmas and birthday we go through this.
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hi ya, fellas.  To infinity and beyond!
It's Sid!
Yessss!  Ah, ha, ha, ha...
This is ludicrous.
I can't hold on much longer!
Do you know you've lovely hair, even if you torment it in those braids.
A sin against <i>what?</i>
Home is where the heart is.
Do what?  Oh, I see.
He'll be looking for another apprentice.
I thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
How long has -
So had I.
Did you do this?
Victoria -
Oh no you can't. Get on with the painting.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
I... I don't really know.
He's not here.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Oh, it is?
None of my friends can fucking believe my dad is the actual Drug Czar.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
Sixteen
Are you kidding...  I'm staying with you --
I have dreams about this, actual dreams about busting the top people, the rich people, the white people.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
One chance here, Eduardo.  Make us believe you got a boss.  No boss, it's all on you.
So go shower already.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
No, but a lot of other people.  You should come.  You should come out with us.
One question.  How did you find about this?
Does this offer include my partner?
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Salazar's been taken down.  He was working for Porfirio Madrigal.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Did you tell him?
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I don't know, maybe I'll buy something for my ma, and then buy some good speed, no bicarb like, then get a girl, take her out like, and treat her -- properly.
Twenty thousand.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
Jesus.
I'd fucking kill you.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Unless you get caught.
What? Steady like?
Happy birthday.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Thanks, Mark.
But try too hard --
It's a tightrope, Spud, a fucking tightrope.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Four Grand.
That's tough.
How long is it?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
But the shuttle-
What's Emergency Landing Plan B?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Join my quest.
But how?
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Concentration is vital. You must be one with the rock.
I don't understand.
What are you doing?
"Pack Up Your Troubles."
Captain?
Go to sleep, Spock.
I cannot be certain.
Klingon vessel now entering quadrant. Bird of Prey. Estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
If I activate them now, Captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
...mark two.


Borgus Frat.
I am a Starfleet Officer.
I don't understand...
Sybok.
You did break in.
Are you embezzling?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Dillinger?
Your old files -- ?
How's it going upstairs?
To warn him.
We have to close that down, just briefly. Security reasons.  Someone with that access has been tampering.
Mmm. Part of the Master Control Program?
I'm your program?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I'm sorry -
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
You wouldn't dare.
User requests are what computers are for.
Who is your User, program?
Dumont!
Flynn!!
Hey... you guys OK?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
What's goin' on?
you have any idea how much I can sue these jokers for?
Thank. you, Master Control.
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Yes...acknowledge, Master Control...
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
New guy...
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
That's not true, honey--
I'm done.
There are going to be some changes Dana.  You're going to start following some rules.  And I'm going to be there to see that you do.
You're kidding.
Son of a bitch!
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
Guy's a spook!
Give me the page.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Yes.
I'm late.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
Would you say he was boring, then?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
What?
Louder please.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Not yet.  But we'll find him.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
Get going! 
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
I understand.
Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert					* operation.  And this one got a little rough.
What's happened?
To our assignment.
It's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that, I--
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
What do you want me to do?
Let me speak to Clarence.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Tell him we gotta go.
The letter I sent.
The oriental.
Want some Goobers?
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I took a cab.
Tell me about yourself.
So he really loved her?
A real live pimp?
You will?
You better not be fucking teasing me.
I do.
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Where you goin', honey?
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
If I thought I could get away with it -
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
Who the fuck are you?
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm a married man.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
I certainly hope so.
Is he big league?
The zoo.
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
I'd fuck Elvis.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
Elliot.
No.
Say it, goddamn it!
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
What?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
I don't believe you.
Oh, don't bother. I got one.  So you're a Sicilian, huh?
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
That was very good.
Could we try it now?
We talked him into it.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
You gotta hold this for me.
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?
Yeah, I live here.
Yes.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I need to go now.
I need to go.
I have to go.
I love this air.  This is wonderful air.
Why do you think there aren't any germs in the air, James?
James, where did you grow up?  Was it around here?  Around Baltimore?
You told me you'd help me.  I know this isn't what you meant, but...I was desperate... no money...bum leg... sleeping on the streets. I probably smell bad.  Sorry about that. But then I saw your book in a store window with a notice about your lecture.  I can read, remember?
You'd prefer that? ... James...you don't really have a gun, do you.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Are you hurt?
Mason???
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
No, not really.  It's...it's in my mind.  Like you said.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
You had a bullet from World War One in your leg, James!  How did it get there?
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
What are you talking about???
But you know what's real now?
Don't be defensive, Kathryn, this isn't an inquisition.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
You want to go in?  Examine him?
What?  What did you say?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Oh, Jesus.
Maybe I do.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
Thirty-bucks?  That's it?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
Twenty-after-ten.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
You son of a bitch!
You believe that?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
No!
That yours, Mrs. McKenna?
Who was that on the phone?
They look nice.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You didn't hear something?
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Do you have to call me that?
Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the state fair.  It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
Nice house for a Shaman's daughter. You must be good.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Is it pretty?
Where?
He's got money.  In a floor safe in the living room.  I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  More like brags.  He loves his money.  Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
How much money has he got?
John?  John where are you going?
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?
There is no us, remember?
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
If you want.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?
He was a crooked bastard.  He would have killed us.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?
Grace, listen to me.  In the trunk of my car is a rope.  It should reach down here.  Got get it, throw it down and I'll climb up.
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Husband . . .?
Where you headed?
Hey!
I bet she led you on good, didn't she?  Taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  Bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  Then me busting in like some wild bear.  Bet you had a fire going under you.
Like you don't know.
Just ran into a little trouble.
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You're talking like a mad man.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Maybe . . . ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
I need thirteen.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
The sooner it's over, the sooner you're on your way.  Now listen to me:  It's got to look like an accident; that's the thing.  If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
No.
Came close this time and it scares you.
Drop it, Jake.
All I have in the world.
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.
Trouble with the car again?
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Come on, Jake--
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
Honest, Toby.  I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
For defending my honor this afternoon.
What the hell are you talking about?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
You're fucked.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Mister!
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
The old lady?
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Suppose you've had all you can of Sierra.  What with that ruckus you had with Toby.  Oh yes, I heard all about that.
I think you might just want to do as I say.
Senor, you need a doctor.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Christ no!
Yeah, sure.  You got change?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick.
Oh, Jesus.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
You broke my nose!
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
California...
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Would I what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I'm not rambling.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
How do you want it?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I came for Grace.
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
But you was going to fight for me.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Yeah, I can fix it.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang."
I don't have a goddamn credit card.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
No! Okay! Okay!
Darrell.
No.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Jesus.
Where you coming from?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
Where you headed?
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Are there snakes out here?
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
You'd never understand.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
But I thought --
Anywhere?
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
Why?
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much?
You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
No sir he is not.  I read about you in the paper.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I don't think I got the job in New York.
When was the last time I wore pink?
Yes.
Rust?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
But not a knife?
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
He's doing well today.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
What's he look like?
When?
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
Not really.
How are you feeling?
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
She's gonna live.  She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.
I fined 'em instead.
Ain't you seen enough blood for one night? Hell, Alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. They're hard workin' boys that was foolish. Why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
Rain's coming.
Why, if you were to point a pistol at a King or a Queen, sir, I can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He give 'em names?
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
Three days. Are you hungry?
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
No?
Them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
I could run off them whores.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
Duke.
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
What'd Ned say?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.  I ain't touched a drop in ten years. My wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
I don't never see nobody anyhow.
Huh?
Finish him, Ned.
Tell me right off if you see him.
That was... the first one.
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
Huh?
You ain't like that no more.
Quincy, he was always watchin' me. Scared.
He ain't shootin' our way no more.  He's shootin' over that way. Who's he shootin' at over that way?
You suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Steal it? Naw, I didn't steal it.
Well, this here's Ned Logan... Ned, this here's the Schofield Kid, nephew of Pete Sothow an'...
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
See that scrub oak yonder?
He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I'm having a stroke.
So what is it you do, Mr. Kint?
DON'T MOVE, YOU FUCKERS.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
You heard right.
Keaton, we gotta go. They're gonna find him.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
Did you hear what he just said?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Maybe more.
What did you say?
I'11 find him.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Right.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
I came clean. I told it like it happened on the boat. So what if I left out how I got there? It's got so many holes in it, the D.A. would've told me to blow amnesty out my ass. So you got what you wanted out of me. Big fucking deal.
Give a guy a break, huh?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
No...
He left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. You saw him die, right? Or did you? You had to hide when the first police cars showed up. You heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.
If he's dead, Verbal - if what you say is true, then it won't matter. It was his idea to hit the Taxi Service in New York, wasn't it? Tell me the truth.
You're not safe on your own.
I'm fine.
What did he find?
Very good.
And no one will know the truth.
What is the truth?
This is going to drive the ante up.
Well, many reasons, actually...
Objection, we've...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
No further questions.
Yes.
... that's all right.
What is this going to cost?
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Yes.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much ...
No.
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
And ask me what?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Overruled...
Exception!
The TV didn't work.
I'm a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
And is that what you're going to do?    Is that what you're going to do...?
Is this a bad time.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
I...do you want me to leave?
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
What is that to you...?
Hi, Mickey ...
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
They had an obstetrical nurse in there.  We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what?
Yeah?  How's our new witness?
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
That's right.
The Doctors.
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
Uh...the admitting nurse...
The broad has disappeared...
...four years ago...
I talked to Johnnie White at the Bar Association.   The broad used to work for one of Concannon's partners in New York awhile ago.   She wanted to move to Boston.    How badly did she hurt us, Joe?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
What?
How old is he?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Who told you that?
Mrs. Simmonds.
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Yes.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
How long have you been back?
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
What happened?
What about?
I told you! Right here!
Can I see you tomorrow?
No.
You want me to dress like her?
Ah, no!
Well?
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Some money.
Why?
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I don't know.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
Madeleine --
Let me go into the church alone.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
Her car is gone.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
From that music.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Sorry, old man. Work.
I think I can lick it.
Johnny!
Here you are.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
She died.
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
You're an asshole.
Multiple reasons.
Don't point at me.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
Wait!
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
We've already done this.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Boyd you idiot, the shit's coming down!
Fuck you Boyd!
We'll be ready Adam.
I won't do it.
I know...
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Your investment ideas never work out.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
I'm calling the police.
Shut up Boyd.
Take care of business.
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
Yeah.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Your ideas never work out.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
Easy Micheal.
Stop it!
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
I think I forgot the tent.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
He is.
He's a moron.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
What kind of seats can we have?
You go down there.
I need your help.
Of course.
That's sweet.
Hello.
Where are you?
Okay.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
What?
Do you love me?
You fucked a prostitute?
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
Harry Chaplin. "Cats in the Cradle."
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
The wahoo?
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
I guess.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
...embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
A mutant species.
Keep quiet. These miserable brats only get in the way.
So much the better. We'll all fit. How many floors are there?
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
My God, what have you done to him!
So, Ramona!
Where's the dough?
Why?
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Yes. Why?
He's good at rabbiting and he knows it. When we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
They're varicose veins, miss, but some days I can't take care of them.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
Don't say that.
A black bull came.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
Yes!
I'm only good at making people laugh.
You fainted last night after supper. The master and I carried you here.
In English, please.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
There's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer. Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you.
I don't know.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
What's the assignment?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
You made me a composite of 183 of the most vicious people who ever lived.  What do you think I'm doing?
It wasn't a lie.
You ready for this?
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I've been in prison, remember?
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
Hamlet.  What's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7?
Give me a goddam break. I'm not going to go anywhere alone.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
What did you do to those people?
You know I am.
Which way?
You're not capable of it.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
That's why I'm asking.
The only thing I want to hear is your silence.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
You know what?  This is good.  This is terrific, and I'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  This is....
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>... 
Y'see, <u>this</u> is what Producing is:  you put me in a <u>Room</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
Mr. President, this is St...
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
Who we got here...?
Don't you want to know if it's true?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
What's it gonna cost? 
What did Albania ever do to us?
We'll be back tonight.
Your guy gets four more years in Washington...  ...it's only Nine More Days.
Big Bird touches down <u>when</u>?
Find out is there <u>any</u> chance we can get some rain tomorrow, <u>will</u> you...?
Well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
He just got Hip to us.  He just ended the War.

Uh...Didn't we <u>do</u> this?
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We are in <u>contaot</u> with the Albanian Premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  That the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, Enemy Lines. 
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
Well, c'n we get him back home?
Heavy weather East of here.
My name is Ronald Brean.
S'all very well, but when the Fit hits the Shan, somebody's going to have to Stay After School, and who do you 'spose that might be.
Well, I'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  But if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your Job, which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your country and your job.
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Is there a press conference today?
When's he coming back...?
Yes.  Indeed I did. 
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
They got to have something that we want.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
W...what?
I saw it on TV.
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Medal.  Medal and Ribbon.
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
An anti-psychotic...
Mmm.
Uh huh...why?
You can't tell this story.
He raped a <u>Nun</u>...
...but...
What're you doing?
William Schuman.  Old Shoe.  U.S. Army.  Serial number, 21-31-2841-262.

A beret.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
Look, I know you get approached a lot by dubious men, but I'm different, I never talk to strangers, all my life I've been waiting for the right person to walk across the room... you're that person, you don't know it but I do and if you walk away now I'll never see you again or you me. You'll grow old.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
... That's what you told us to say.
He's lying.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
So come home and live rent free, 'stead of that cockroach palace you live in. $50,000 Jesus Christ, the world is off its rocker. I made $37,000 last year and you...
What brings you out here...
Another cup of coffee?
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into...
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
What if they call him?
You sure?
Okay.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
Relax, Roger, everybody's doing it but you don't know, you don't know.
...and you don't have to put up a dime, Roger.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
Jackson, Steinem...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.

'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
What about hard work?
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
"All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate.
How much?
Now, wait a minute, Dad...
Why do you need to wreck this company?
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
You really do believe in destiny?
Devon? He looks like Seattle Slew. What about the Triple Crown?
Well, why stop at that?
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
How you doing Buddy?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
Can't get a little bit pregnant, Bud.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
What do you say we go get a suite at the Carlyle? Caviar? Champagne? Celebrate, just like the old times Sunshine.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
And, I'm pretty sure we got the Beezer Brothers out of Tulsa coming in with us and I'm working on the Silverberg boys in Canada.
With Mark?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
Yeah 
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Anybody want another drink?
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Will you be wanting your wheels today sir?
A party at a waxwork huh?
Can I give her a message?
Haven't we been doing our homework.
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Well?
One has to keep the distance between `them' and `us'
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
Yes?
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
Your husband?
What's happening to me?
Yes, but...
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
She said, "You know."  That I know.
Have you been hurt?
For the Dupont Chair.  I swear.  I'm becoming the nosy old lady I used to run from at Amherst.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
She isn't here.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer.  From next door.  Is everything--
That's not...It's not like that.
I wanted to apologize.
No.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
You should have heard her play.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
You are?
Kambucha mushroom tea...
Thanks, but I'm fine.
You think he killed her?
Someone's there.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
Does Norman know?
Did I?
Oh God...you knew.
Adamant?
Too late?  Jody, it was an accident.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Like what?
Did he say that?
Claire, I have to show up for the--
Whatcha reading?
How are you?
Wanna fool around?
Claire...
I know.
Hi.
Oh.
Where is she then?
What am I looking at?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
The accident...?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
I felt you...looking through me...
It's her.  This is the woman who I've seen.
Stop...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
Leave her out of this!
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Huh.
What?
:Well, they are.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Don't tell Rowan about this.
Michael, Rowan should -
Aaron - lieten to me...  It's been Lasher - from the start!
Then you wear it.
I'm sure he's alright, Bea. They'll find him somewhere.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
I had you sent away.
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Lie...?
STOP!
Do not tell me that!
Only you...
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Let me go...  Michaelllllll...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
Do they keep everything 'out' ...?
you're very --- different.
And whose houses do you design...?
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Stop it.
Rowan...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
She - she said I - I was a ---
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
Hello..
You're just afraid I'll drop dead before I finish the damn house.
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
You alright...?
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Well, Normie - you won't have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  How are the hands...?
Left behind...?  This about Rowan...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
So there is only one key...
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I'm sorry?
What's with all the locks - and hammering
So what do you do?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
Yes...
I don't like sugar
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?
Is LESLIE here?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Dr STECKLER?
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
That's crazy talk.
Cut it out, before you break something!
Don't you know anything about limo etiquette? Everything in here is included for our pleasure.
Hurry.
What is it now?
Don't tell me.  Another vision of incomparable beauty?
Dead?
Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
I miss those days, when schoolyard sexual harassment was without consequence.
God, you are so hot.
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
Well, why should I?
Whatever helps you cope.
There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach...
I know they were simple people, but did this trip help your college fund at all?
Sorry I--
Ted! Do something!
Well?
You're on the next plane home.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
So, what brings you here at his hour?
My room?
You want it in writing?
Are they okay?
You can't come back. That is, you can, but your things will be in the room you currently think of as mine.
I meant biologically.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Well? What do you think of her?
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
I doubt it.
You're amazing.
Cut to the chase, William Randolph. Your audience is way ahead of you.
I'm trembling with excitement.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I see.
Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming.
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
I know where you can find an excellent editor-in-chief.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?"
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
The parties are held in here when the weather dips below seventy. Which is seldom.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
People pay good money for that?
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
You look pretty.
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
That's what they called it when I was in Juvenile.  It's a pretty dismal place.
Where's the body?
Stick with me on this Gloria.  I need you...
About a year ago.
He dropped Jimmy off first?
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Where's this coming from?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
What did you do then?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
What?
I say something funny?
I thought we were goin' to a movie.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
He... Sam Lombardo?
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
Why can't you come...
Hello?
I don't know.  I want to see you...
That never seemed to worry you at the Glades.
That's not your line.
You think that's wise?
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
I was just thinking about where I'm gonna stay.  I lost the house.  It's like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
Who is it?
I'm placing your daughter under arrest.
About what?
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
Yes.
That how you planned it?  You take cut Suzie, get me to hang it on Kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
How much is about six and a half million divided by three?
J. S. Bach.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Starting with a screw?
Come Llewellyn, don't tarry.
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
All what?
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Never seen a gun fire so fast!
So... spontaneous.  All that leaping off buildings and Chinese fighting and whatnot.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Oh, damn!  That's it.
What if these tracks are just leading us to an Indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
There's only seventy-eight.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Listen, in two days I'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  And I want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
French?
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
The first.
They're coming.
You managed alright.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
You are very important, Willow.
Now, you know where you're going?  Down there, through those trees, follow the river.  You'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  Willow, this is serious business.  Don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a Nelwyn.  Give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
I don't want courage.  I don't want to be a warrior.  All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He's no magician.
You a woodcutter?
Because she's sick.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
I'm beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
She said lots of thing.s
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
What do you want!
No!
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
But what am I gonna transform??
She's hungry.
I'm getting her out of there!
This can't be right.  This isn't a sorceress.  This is some kind of animal.
Cows. You know, cows?
Nail it!
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut...  It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.  He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now.  And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
Whacking?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
No, no doctor...
What?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
But Stoltzfus said...
What else can you do?
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
I was being foolish?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
I hear you.
It's me.
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
God, Fred...
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
That has no place in this house.
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Uhhhh -- yes...
Ohhh!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
But the Good Witch of the North told me not to.
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Oh --
I had the measles once -- and she stayed right by me every minute.
But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Here's what I'm taking him in -- so he can't attack me again.
And I was standing over there rusting for the longest time.
We might.
Lions and tigers and bears!
A home --
It's beautiful, isn't it?  Just like I knew it would be.  He really must be a wonderful Wizard to live in a City like that!
Does it work?
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
They're coming back!
I have so got brains.
...free!
To Oz?
Oil can what?
He said his mouth.
Oh -- Oh --
Dorothy next!
Would...would it do any good if I roared?
Wait a minute, fellahs.  I was just thinkin'.  I really don't want to see the Wizard this much.  I better wait for you outside.
I've got a plan how to get in there.
That's right.
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Now, let' s see -- this goes -- Oh, I wish I were better at puzzles.
...junk!
To Oz?
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
Well, I --
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
Then it’s no longer a bomb?
Is there another way?
Construction’s not exactly my line.
They’re getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can’t help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin...
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
What is it?
James...
What the hell are you doing here?
A little. Does it matter? After all, what’s the point of living if you can’t feel alive?  Isn’t that right, Elektra? Isn’t that your motto?
So you killed your father.
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Where?
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
What's your theory?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Yet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be being with me.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
Good Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?
I¹m not.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
His what?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
What caused it?
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Bigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
Call off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
Is that all?
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
Thanks.
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
I think we should send him whatever he wants.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Yorgi masterminded the take-over of three Red Mafiya clans. Cops called it "blood week". He combined all of their global enterprises into one huge crime syndicate: Anarchy 99.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
Don't even start. I'll be honest, I don't trust you. Bur lets pretend for a minute that what you say is true, that I want to leave. What can you do about it?
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
What are you talking about?
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what?
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
Where are we going?
We'll have to go after them.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
Sorry, "dude".
Why you dogging me up?
Help me with this guy.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
What's that?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
Forty-eight hours, old man.  But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
He helped you?
If she held on any longer she could have.
I'll find him.
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Yes, sir.
Still happy you married me?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Darling!?!
Ready, darling?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
What a strange fellow.
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Good night.
No!  Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I put her in the guest room, just down the hall.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
You have more chance of re-animating this knife than you have of mending a broken nervous system,
No, Fred ereck.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
What?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
What a filthy job!
Very little decay.  With this magnificent specimen for a body, all we need now is an equally magnificent brain.  You know what to do!
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Cold!  Cold and dead!
Who are you talking to?
You can say that again.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
MMMMMMMMMM! MMMMMMMMMMMM!
Well...
Yes, you may... but don't make any noise.
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Look, Doctor!
What are you going to do?
Did you do it?
There can never... ever... be anything physical between us. You know that, dear.
It wouldn't be fair to Elizabeth.
And Elizabeth has hers.
Why don't we talk inside?
All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
His schwanzstucker.
It's working!  Oh, Doctor -- you play beautifully.
Yes, sir, name, please?
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
They spurred onto high ground, My Lord, full of spirit and looking for the Zulu. Full of sport they were, My Lord.
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Which one?
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
Lord Chelmsford seems to want me to stay back with my Basutos.
