You always been this selfish?
What good stuff?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Who?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Queen Harry?
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Just for a minute
The prom?  Kat has a date?
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
He always have that shit-eating grin?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
You wanna go out with him?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
Dead at forty-one.
It's her favorite band.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Sure
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
You and Verona?
Just a little.
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
What?
Maybe.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Fallacy.
No, I won't go with you
Why not?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
I didn't care about the money.
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Just for now.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
That ' s what I thought
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
I am, Your Eminence
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
What...?  Do I have so many already?
All of them created by people like me.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
... and also to bring medicine.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
What are you saying?
You'll always be older than me, Father.
New worlds create new people.
A woman?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
God be with us admiral.
Twenty eight.
You think I don't know that?
You bloody...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Then why?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
No.  No way.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
They won't until this is over.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
So...the station is empty?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
No.  I'm okay.
Describe him.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
You wanna talk to her alone?
What would your girlfriend think of that?
Just a shower?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Then do it, asshole.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
How many victims are up there?
I'm not.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
You promise?
Jesus Christ.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Where's Czech girl?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
In here, says he wants a million.
Okay.
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
As a plumber?!
You've got a call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
I'm here for movies.
Excuse me?
No way!  He's mine!
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
Oh yeah, why?
What??
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Okay. 
Oh?
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
You're kidding.
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Did they have any explanation for this?
She's in the bathroom.
Thank you, Daddy.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
That's true
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
I want to pick up my car.
Whaddya mean, buy?
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Here's hoping, baby...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Luther was part of the gang?
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Thank you.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
How much?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
Who gives a fuck what you think?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
You made the front page.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Jack?  What was that?
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Can't complain.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
First, the money.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Leeloo..
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
...Ma???
Found it?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Just one... why me?
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Apipoussan?
You noticed..
OK, you can turn around!
I want to sleep... forever...
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
To fame.. salud..
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Right here.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Who is this.
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
How'd you find me here?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
Show me where you buried her.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
Of what sort?
Shut your mouth and drive!
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
I'm not a cop.
You're learning.
Alright, I get the picture.
Who is he, his name?
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
The checks were for odd amounts...
You're one hell of a detective, Mrs. Christian.
Yes, but...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
No.
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
It got to be too much for him.
You try going through what we did. Bob couldn't take it, that's all. Christ, there's times when it still seems like I can't either.
Okay.
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Certainly, Senator.  If I can ever be of further assistance.
What's wrong?
Yeah, or turn you into toast.
Sounds like a game show host to me.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Why can't we just talk to the authorities?
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Debbie.  She's gone.  I've...collected her, like the others.
Enough of that crap.
So?
She's blaming herself for Sheila.  I know how it feels.  I've been thinking about Kristen.  Maybe I could've stopped it, if I'd listened.
Your distraught.  It'll help...
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
How did you know that?
She doesn't want me around
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
I've got to go.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
He must've wandered up from the children's ward.  I just wondered what was wrong with him.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
So did Dan.
I'm going to see what else I can find out about Mr. Fred Krueger
That's their problem.
But I've seen her grave.
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Two hours a day, six days a week.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
It was moderate.  He'll be all right.  But it was out of the question, his coming along.
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
That may be.  But Dad stays where <u>he</u> is, and I'm staying here!
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
You know - it <u>is</u>?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
We hope!
High-intensity arcs will burn, submerged.  And millions of volts...discharged in random directions...
It'll be all right.  We're old friends!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
You don't believe me?
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
How soon?
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Damn straight!
Oh.
Yeah.
Right!
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
Where'd you get the blood?
What blood?
Saw him do it?
What the fuck you telling me, Wade? I never seen the guy get shot, I told you that.
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Yeah.
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
To us it was.
What then?
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Pop?
I don't know. For the food business. I guess. I just thought, you know, we'd sneak a Big Mac on Mommy, like we used to.
I'm not saying that.
A hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.
Yes, Wade, I mean Twombley. Put out that cigarette. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.
I wish you had. I'd rather be deer hunting instead of freezing my ass on that fucking grader.
Well, right now we're not too interested. Finish up what you gotta do, then you can get bugged on your own time.
On what you pay me?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Mel Gordon.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
Wade.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
Aw, c'mon, I was only saying there's something wrong with "Home Made Cooking", that's all. The sign's fine. What it says is wrong.
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
The other guy.
Where... how'd you hear that?
It's called a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
She's coming.
Bang!
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Yeah, I know him -- the kid that was with him. Maybe you do too. Jack Hewitt. He works for LaRiviere with me. He's my best friend.
No shit.
Yeah, I guess.
Get some sleep.
I think your first response to the Twombley shooting was the correct one.
Then who shot him?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Not particularly.
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
I know, Mom.  It was great... really.
Some kids were teasing you?
How `bout a hug for the old man.
Got it.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
We don't know that.
Put together a score sheet.  I'll make some calls.
To swear you in as President.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
How many others killed?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Scared. We're scared.
Cooperation. If you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. Good day.
One thing I've learned as
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Yes. You've made yourself quite clear.
I'm sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. Land the plane and we'll trade you hostages for fuel.
Gravity.
Yes, sir.
Excuse me?
Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get tens of thousands killed. I can't live with that.  I'm not royalty. I'm an elected official and the integrity of the office of the President is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  We don't negotitate. Not as long as I'm President. Is that understood?
Where's my family?
Yes, sir.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
I'm so excited, Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Negative.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
What...?
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Yes. Yes, of course.
I love you.
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
And a little ice.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Who wants to be first?
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
What is it?
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
A virgin.  I find that very arousing...
I like my horizons narrow.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
Nothing's wrong.  I just want to get something straight.  You agree that there's a good chance these two shootings are somehow related, right?
Back off, George.
Come on, let's go, dude.  Surf's up!
Why?
Harcourt is dead.
But there's no more drug.
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
No... two.
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Yeah -- we met him.  Wonderful boy... close personal friend of George's here.
Ss'kya'ta'.
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah.
It is. 
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Rescue mission.  There's some juicy colonists' daughters we gotta rescue from virginity.
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
That's the plan.  My word on it.
She's right.
Sorry to disappoint you.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
We ain't going anywhere.
Fuck you.
What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
They're right on us.  Vasquez, how you doing?
Can't be.  That's inside the room!
No.. I've slept enough.
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
You mean dead.
Sssh.  Don't move.  We're in trouble.
No.
Well even if there is, I don't think you want to get involved with this one.
Why?
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
I'll be right back.
And how will you make him keep it?
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
That's stupid.
Do you think that's funny?
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
Well, don't do that again!
Oh, damn!
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
You'd think I was mad.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Tonight?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
When, may I ask?
But you can't take her without reference. It's unheard of!
Be careful!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
Michael, please! I'm sure you will find her most willing, Herr Mozart. She's really very excited. She's been preparing all morning.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Wine?
Finally! Such an immense joy. Diletto straordinario!
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Which few did you have in mind, Majesty?
Sire, the whole opera is finished. Do you know how much work went into it?
Of course, welcome! Welcome ten thousand times. Papa! my Papa!
Don't you have a maid?
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
How many pupils do you have?
Oh, let's not talk about it.
Didn't I? I thought I did. I'm sure I did.
No one calls you that.
She does. She says I sleep all day.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
What?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
And which one of them do you want me to teach?
Well, yes! on the whole. I suppose.  How long have you been playing, Fraulein?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
How could I not?
It really is the best music one can hear in Vienna today. Don't you agree?
How is that possible? You give concerts, don't you? I hear they are quite successful.
Of course not.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
How could I not?
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
Yes.
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
Yes.
I'm not leaving you.
I am so ashamed.
No, but I'm the best.
A little modesty would suit you better.
Why not? It's charming. I mean, I don't actually show concubines exposing their! their! It's not indecent!  It's highly moral, Majesty. It's full of proper German virtues. I swear it. Absolutely!
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Leave me alone.
Ah - you've heard that?
What difference does that make?
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
Exactly.
Well done, Sire!
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Who is she?
Come with me. And stay in the room.
Yes, I am looking after him.
I'll call tomorrow.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
He said 'Jack'.
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, a cab will be faster.
I expect you shortly.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
Sorry.
Aw come on, Alex!
Right.
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Yes?
Anything.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Why are you doing this to me?
Oh, come on, tell us.
What time is it?
Alex?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Yes.
She's a jerk.
I don't know.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Look at that.
Wrong.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
Pecos Bill.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
Do you think it's a dog?
I'll tell you when we get there.
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
What do you think?
I will not accept this! Now go away!
You don't have to say anything.
I want you to meet some people.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Oh.
But listen, Tom, I—
Yeah - sure!
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
It was more than that last week.
Yeah.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
All right, let him! I'm sick and tired of hearing about him. If he wants to run the bank, let him do it. I don't want any part of it.
Not at all. That's Alexander Hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. Those are his exact words, gentlemen. Character!  It's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
I know, Dickson. That's all very well. But you're taking too many chances. In these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. In case of emergency!
We'll discuss that in the board room.
What do you mean, help?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
That's very simple. I was home.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
If you don't mind, Inspector, I'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. You see, she's married.
Oh!
You understand?
Fifty thousand dollars!
But I didn't kill that man last night. Honest I didn't, Mr. Dickson!
I'm sorry, Dude, but—I—
But Dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
Being alone with you has always done this to me. You know that.
Well, what?
My apartment.
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
I guess I have said enough  I'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
The theatre?
Happy now?
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Yes, sir.
All right. Send him in.
I haven't any.
You haven't got a uniform?
Aw, go on, forget it. You came through, didn't you? That's all I wanted. A lot of them didn't think you would. You don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. It's been swell. Well, when are you and Helen going to get married?
There you are.
Was Mrs. Dickson there?
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
If he can do it, yes.
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
Yes, sir.
Please, lady. Please be quiet. Everything will be all right.  Open up here, folks. All right, folks, please!
Yes.
Well . . . ?
All right, dear.
Mr. Williams . . .
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
No. It wasn't earlier because...
Yes.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Frankly, yes. I'm feeling a little left out.
Nope.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
Listen, he's my brother and I don't want to start trouble...
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
It was exciting.
Let's ride.
I got three.
Sure, cousin.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
The brown one.
Oh, you're in charge? We ain't partners any more, Jesse? You tell Cole Younger where and when to ride?
Cole, he didn't mean that.
Where is Jesse James?
All right, all right.  Jesse James never yelled at folk...
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
I had you covered.  From back there.
Shit.
My little Web did that?
So we got a plan?
Maybe, maybe...
I swear I'll shoot you in your sleep.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
It's the scientific method. It's all the rage.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
No, I --
Got any ideas, little brother?
Yeah.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
Everything but the boring parts.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Mostly. It would be an all right life, for a bachelor.
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
Now wait a minute. There are certain things that have to wait until after the wedding.
Jesse, have you ever noticed that when you're trying to charm your way out of trouble, your accent gets all farm boy?
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
Right here in church?
You and Frank and Cole, and even Bob, get all these girls because you're good looking and famous. You don't have to pay. They just look at me like I'm the baby brother.  Don't tell anyone, okay Jesse?
It's his money.  He's putting up the payroll out of his own fortune. You do want to hurt Thaddeus Rains, don't you Jesse?
This time we'll make an exception.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Don't talk about it much, though.
THEN WHO DID?!
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Uh huh.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
I don't want to talk about it.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
But what about the past? Our past?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
But where?
What are the rules for a sweater vest?
That's bone. And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
Lucky, I guess.
Commes des Garcon.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving.
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life?
Sorry. 
Hmmmm.
What are I doing?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
She's from...France.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
I think his family wants this kept quiet.
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Your address?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Yeah. You know...hang out.
No, he just hung out there.
His girlfriend doesn't think so.
That's so typical, isn't it?
0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
It's...it's...all right.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
Cecelia is, well...you know 
No way. You have this -- destiny.
That's what I'm asking myself. Does he have some genius stowed away? Why not let him write Skywire.  'Not saying it makes sense.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
...Why?
Okay, yeah. I did something naughty... There's this amazing Comix store in Seattle.  To tell you the truth, I did it once or twice at Stanford. 'Guess I can't keep anything from you...
Great.
You're just afraid to eat it.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
I don't think he knows how.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
It was racially motivated. He's Chinese. He was. And... I know sometimes the FBI gets involved with that. Don't they?
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
You better believe everybody's trying to sign him up.
Too fast? At least four companies're on the verge of workable convergence systems, Milo, they --
Did you?
'Have a look?
'Sorry about the late notice...
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
Maybe we should all get on it.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
You do?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Those really weird, short lines.
Any irregularity in the pattern.
Let's get him in here.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
Why would you do a thing like --
They're already watching you. If they had to, they'd give him this drug that mimics an alcoholic blackout. He'd wake up not even remembering his "act of revenge."
Certainly not at my happy home.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Thank God.
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
Wait a second. He knows I know.
I don't know.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
She's a programmer?
You're not listening.
What do you want, Mr... Cunningham, was it?
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
Care for some saki?
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Kiss me.
Is it about my teeth?
Oh, you're very clever. Let's make love, you silly, hairy little man.
We know all that, Exposition.
I'm afraid not. Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London.
Oh, and Austin...
No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long- since retired. Ms.  Kensington is her daughter.
Oh, and Austin...
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you.
Excuse me?
Carnies.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
Good on ya, man.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
Do I make you horny? Randy, you know. To you, am I eros manifest?
Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device. Oh, and finally, this.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Here, use mine.
Why?
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
Let me tell you a story. There's these two bulls on top of a hill checking out some foxy cows in the meadow below. The young bull says, 'hey, why don't we run down the hill and shag us a cow?', and the wise old bull replies, 'no, why don't we walk down the hill and shag all the cows?'
No worries, luv. We'll just give Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...
Why?
Don't worry, baby. I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India. I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis.  Just watch me. Watch me, now.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Likewise.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
That's a direct order. You didn't see a thing!
Right. Okay. Moving on.
Ya wohl-- I mean, yes wohl, Herr Doctor. I have created the ultimate weapon to defeat Austin Powers. Bring on the Fembots!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
I have one simple request-- sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? Remind me again why I pay you people? What do we have?
Please allow me to demonstrate.
An evil petting zoo?
And that's how you want to live your life, is it?
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
What did you say?
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
I love you, Vanessa.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
... bottle ...
Red ...
Then you can't come in.
Then who wins?
Looks like rain, Steed...
You killed my husband.
Speaking of Peter, there's more good news: You won't even have to change your last name. You'll always be Mrs. Peel.
A kipper. Or a red herring? What were they investigating?
An eccentric recluse?
You should be dead.  How do you feel?
Strange.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
I should have thought that was obvious ...  I'm in mourning.
Don't bother.  Here's a bus ...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
It wasn't me; you have my word.
Is that all?
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
Father. She gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by Dr. Darling.
Makes two of us.
I fail to see --
... and now?
Dead, I'm afraid.
You.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
Really -- you went with him for two years.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
She's mine!
But how can I do that?
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
No, Cole, I...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Good...
You better not have too much joy.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
I love you.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Any time, Al.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
What's going on?
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Screw that.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
Milt?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Olivier's in that, right?
Take care.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
I don't know.
No.  I need a drink.
It isn't safe, man. Don't go splittin' us up. Not with this one.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Stevie... I...
I want to thank you for coming to my graduation, Stephen. It was a great inspiration to me.
Not likely.
I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother "you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?
Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
-- You split the team, man. And what was that crap with the standpipe? You'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
He didn't listen? He was a fucking candidate! He was your responsibility. He shouldn't have been there in the first place, Stephen.  You burned him.
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
I saw it before it got them. I tried to yell, but... He asked me to look out for him. And I didn't do it. I let him die.
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
It's a small town.
What?
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Look, I knew your father, he had a helluva reputation on this job. But that don't mean you get any slack. Swayzak sends you down here, okay, I gotta eat you, that's the rules and I got nothing to say about that. But Swayzak or no, you live with me. Step out of line, and I don't care who knows you, I'll swing the hammer.  You think you're the first?
Glass?
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Nice bunch of guys.
Did a little check on the consulting firm that wrote the report. They did exactly one job -- Swayzak's manpower study. It's not even really a company. No employees, no directors, just a PO Box.
Then who wrote the report?
Yeah.
I've been lying here hours... just thinking... We're close...  We're not looking in the right place, Brian. This one knows us and we're not looking in the right place...
Four months?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
I'm busy.
Here we go...
He's going to be a fireman.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
I...  It used to be, when I was a kid, what meant most to me about this job was there were no ifs. Life and death, right and wrong. When someone called the fire department, we came... Those guys don't know how much I love them... You don't leave people hanging... cause that's what it's all about. It's loyalty. It's 'till death do us part. Isn't that what you heard?... It's you go, we go... Cause without that, it's the end of families, it's the end of the fire department... and when the fire department stops coming... that's the end of the fucking world...  I'm sorry I came, Helen, it's just... it's just there's nobody I can talk to...  I miss you.
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
There's something else kinda interesting...
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
He works for me.
-- Burn them.
-- Burn it all.
I might.
I need to get in the trunk.
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
I know.  Take care of yourself, man, OK? Be cool.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
Let me think about it.
Double or nothing? Are you fucking out of your mind?
I'm on it.
Give me some?
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Please.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
You might be right.
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
How much?
We was coming to see you.
We're starving.
Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other.
DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!!
That's right.  Money turns the wheel.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Why?
Mantan!!
I won't do it anymore.
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister.
We think so.
Calm down, please.
Go away, unless you got my money.
Another one of your conspiracies to hold ya career back?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
I'm in till the end.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Thanks.
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
I said no such thing.  All I said is that something must be wrong.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
I can't go all the way down south.
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present.
This is a TV show, not a music video.
You're welcome.  You shouldn't give up on performing.
I envy you.  That's the way I want to feel about my work.
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's.
Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat.
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
We should go out on a double date.
...I heard different, thought that was...
...too late, maybe around...
Hold on, you allegorical hypothesis. Don't cross words with me.
Why don't you answer?
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
How do you do, sir?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Have you not a man whom you value?
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
What is to be done?
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Is he all right, papa?
Dark Valdez.
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Yeah --
You saved Kendall's life --
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
Epilepsy.
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
How do you know that?
We just want to check your pack --
You're the only one missing a grenade.
If not you, then who?
That's exactly what he says about you.
Who you gonna trust, Ray? Him or your friend?
Bullshit.
Coast Guard, special detective detail. We feel this incident may have put the beaches of Florida at risk.
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
But not the only victim, right?
How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten.
Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury -- they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
I don't know --
Maybe he...
What kind of trouble are you in?
It's not West, is it? Tell me it's not West.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
And I'm the closest thing to it, right?
What about the confession?
I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has --
The Senator...
What are you talking about?
You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
Get your hands away from the desk!
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Yes.
That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me -- murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people -- it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have tried harder to witness it for you --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
That bugs you too?
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You wanted to get the truth.
You mean the falsely accused?
No.
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
Yeah.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
I don't think I want to hear this --
We've been making progress, I see.
Wrong answer --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer -- you said you burned yours?
The fuck are you talking about --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Terrible tragedy. One of those Section Eight boys worked in here. Pike. Heard he got out okay.
He's not Army, it's not official --
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Fine, I will.
Fine, I'm doing it.
How would you describe him?
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
And I like you.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
I can.
That poet, Norther Winslow did. He was going to Paris, France. He must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  Tell you what. You take the other way and I'll cut through here. Meet you on the far side.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
I'm not scared.
So how does it happen?
There's a lot you don't know about me.
You're right.
Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They were hauling it down to Texas for drinking water, only they didn't count on an elephant being frozen inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.
What?
I've told you a thousand facts. That's all I do, Will. I tell stories.
Yes. Exactly.
How did you get so many?
I have the rest of my life to find out.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
Yes.
Did you?
Mmm, what. I know better than to argue romance with a French woman.
We rented a car.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
We'll stop then.
Leave him!
Ch...
Right.
Good. 
Right.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
I...
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Good night.
John.
They go.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
No I don't.
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
Have you got your passport?
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Sometimes.
You are throwing me out.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Not really. Maybe a little.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
It's not mine either.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Yeah, I know.
My little niece... she got this deep cough.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
I do. God's truth. I do.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Marv, let's get Ronnie set up here.
You been home yet?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
It's not her fault, Gill. She's had to take care of me all this time, cuz I'd just start throwin' up... choking. Just losin' my grip. And she listened. She listened to me.  And... I got better. I don't get nervous like I used to. And since we been together... she been faithful to me. Put all that junk behind her...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
Say what you gotta say, but I ain't gonna hear you speak his name to me. Not never. You hear?
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
I keep the heat on.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
Let go of my arm...
Or what? OR WHAT?
SHUT UP! SHUT UP!
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Uh-uh.
Gal, I been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. And let me tell you...
Sure.
I'm here with you.
I had love in my heart. And I gave it to one woman. And she gone now.  Where am I gonna put all this love?
You can handle it.
Yeah, gal I been here before.
I know that.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
Uh-huh.
Naw!
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
One thing at a time, Laz.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
She's tied to me, R.L.. We tied to each other.
Rae...
Yeah, I know.
Ronnie...
Get rid of it.
-- I should tear your head off.
You said that in the last two places.
I hope not.
What'd she say?
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
I don't, that's all.
A snitch?
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
Ichiro --
Let's go.  Him first.
I couldn't tell.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
Then take it from him.
Why?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
Your plane's at nine a.m.  Be on it. That's orders.  Period.
We're police officers.
You had my help, detective.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
You certainly have a nice place here.
Well, no, not really.  There's Mr. Deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
Well, actually
You're androids.
His company made us.
No.
When do you deliver your project?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Who.
Your customer, eh?
I know all that.
And what in your estimation works?
No thanks.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Meaning?
They'll change the limit before I change my mind.
You sure?
Do you recognize any of them?
What's suck night?
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
It would be my child.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
You did?
What?
I don't like people snooping around my stuff.
Because it's not.
What difference will it make?
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
What's up?
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Nothing is infallible, but so far the Voight-Kampff scale bas been foolproof.
Sitting next to you.
All pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an Esper 231 -- I believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
Thanks.
Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now...
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Are you French?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
No.
Watching television in color.
Why doesn't it never work out?
What?
Doing what?
What's fair?
Okay.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Everybody's divorced.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
He has a computer?
Uh...yeah.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Really?  Okay!
Yes, sir.
Of course!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Yes, sir. It's true.
You nut!
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
That would knock my father out.
I'm not wearing his pants.
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
The sky!!!
The sky?  Where?
Just look!!
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, you got a problem with that?
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
I'll be all right.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
No.  They all do.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Then after that it's safe.
If I...you know...
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
No.
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
Amen.
What are you doing here?
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I think...it...works.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Darling, where are the glasses? Oh, here they are.
Yep, that's right. Let's take a look at it.
It must be great.
Okay.
I wanted to see you.
Nobody.
No. Come on.
Sure I'm alright. 
See my nipples?
Don't say that.
Who's it, you mean.
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
I sure don't hate you.
Are you a bad boy?
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
No, it's not Don.
There's so much I want to tell you. I'm in so much darkness though with things moving. There is darkness sucking me. It's kissing me and darkness is entering me. In every hole. It's opening me to a death.
I did. Are you?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
Bull.
Baby wants to fuck.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though, you're okay. You shot a real son of a bitch.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Yeah. okay.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. Left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Let's go.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
Yes.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Jeffrey? Why?
You like mysteries that much?
Okay.
You can change it if you want to.
Okay.
You sound real remorseful.
MEEE! ME! I'm the guy! I know everyone, their habits, where they hang out, who they talk to. I know where they fuckin' live. We could kill everyone!
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
What?
I don't know they just always need it.
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Aye.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
That depends. You either do your job or get ethical.
They were wearing masks.
The what man?
And the pennies?
The Sicilians.
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Brilliant. So now we got a Huge guy theory and Serial crusher theory. Top fucking notch.  What's your name?
Twist of lemon!
Eight.
Witness?
No way they could have seen it.
Hallelujah, Jaffar.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Y'know it is, a bit.
So let's kill the motherfucker. I mean, what are you guys... like that's your new thing right?
Well, what'ya do?
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Yes! Yes! I was thinking that, too. No. I was feeling it. All I needed was to hear you say it! Amen! I'll help them.
Open it!
He's a nigger.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Fuck you Vincenzo.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
What does Starsky say?
How was I ridiculing you?
Yeah, I heard that.
Just turn right here.
No, Dignan. It's not your gun. It's all of ours.
There's another stocker, right?
Because my mom gets the bill.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
You were spoiled rotten.
No. We didn't.
They don't?
On the left.
Yes... It's true.
He told you and you let him do it.
OK.
What?
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
$383.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Ah. Couple days ago.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
We all set?
What?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
He stole a tractor.
That's a sharp jacket.
That sounds like Dignan.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Future Man. You know. Cause he looks like he's from the future.
Phil probably provoked him.  Where's he going?
Why not?
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Yeah, but he still has the aggravation. Three days sitting in a cell.
No. I wasn't adopted.
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
God, yes. Like silk.
That's your friend Anthony?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
I don't know about that.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
Not even for emergencies?
Can you use a coaster.
OK, Bob.
I'll just drive my car.
I warned you, Dignan.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I don't know.
It's registered in my mother's name.
Watch me.
What is it?
What's his name?
Let's go.
Not bad.
Bullshit.
That's OK.
Jesus Christ.
It looks pretty good. There's nobody back here.
He's stuck between two floors.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
I'm trying.
This is no good.
The basic grammatical rules of robbing.
We're just going over a few things.
I don't know. Maybe in literature. That's his section.
Got a little lucky.
Fuck you. You a Hoto.
It's locked.
Nice to meet you.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
Well, whatever he's doing, I've had enough -- this is now a search and destroy mission.  I want the Berlin police fully briefed and --  -- get this out to all the agencies.
Why not? It was just money.
What do you have, Danny?
It was staged?
Including Landy...  She had access to the archives.
I'm sorry.
Conklin.
Pamela Landy?
How long? How long do I have -- 
-- my coat -- but we should --
It's just a nightmare.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
What?
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
There's no choice.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
Who?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
Now. Show now.
Is there. Is all there.
Who's this?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
Are you an expert in amnesia?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
What the hell is a "Treadstone?"
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
It was in Latin, sir.
Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak Latin? We have to fix that, won't we?  Did he give the poetic benediction? The Lord bless thee and keep thee? Patris Benefactum et --  ...It was Malcolm's favorite.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
So let the council swear publicly.
Homage is nothing. It is the crown that matters!
He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he has not yet bled to death or had his throat cut for him, he will not survive the winter. It is very cold -- is it not, our flower?
It's up to us, Hamish!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
If he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! I will deal with him.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
No. You don't choose your dreams. Your dreams choose you.
And I with you. But you must wake.
That is not possible.
Peace is made is such ways.
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
And the common man who bleeds on the battlefield, does he risk less?
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
I must... consult with my father.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
It could be extremely useful to jog his memory. See if he remembers anything new the next day. And I'll have the test results back in a few days.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Nine, ten. And you're awake! Open your eyes, dammit!
Fix?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
But I... I need those books.
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
So how's Tommy?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
I know, but...
Go on. Sit down.
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
Yeah?
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
I'm over it. Whenever I try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
And I'll tell the Child Protective Services about your kiddie porn endeavors. One step closer and I'll shove this up your ass!
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Y... yes. I guess I did.
What?
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Meant no offense.
I thought I was the bad guy!
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Oh my God oh my God...
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Ain't gonna work this time, buddy. Look how small that fuse is! I'll get killed.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
So you decided to go to America.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Well?
How long can I afford to stay closed?
I'm awfully sorry.
I'd better be going.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
What do you want for Sam?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Rick? Who's he?
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
Yes.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
May we proceed with the business?
This is hardly the time or the place.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
What else, my dear Major?
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
A leader, like Laszlo?
Find one.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
The clipper to America.
Huh!
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Yeah? Why?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Sam's piano.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
There seems to be no secret about that.
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Then don't have a drink.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Catch another fish tomorrow.
Moon's too bright.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
There was an unavoidable delay.
Possible.  So you did those wings?
Had a package to deliver.
Must be a story there.
Let's take a look.
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
For when I travel?
Could you watch Jango?
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad?  Don't tell me you're mad.  Be mad.  Be who you are right now.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Not when you have no choice.
That's what I told the fish I caught. But I ate them anyway.
You too.
And how was your Christmas?
There's a sweep leaving Memphis in an hour, goes through Sydney.
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Which I didn't have.
But all that's behind me.  I'm fine now.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Well, when that IV runs out, you're through with us.  Just the dentist tomorrow.
Sure.
Don't you even think about it.
The place is falling apart.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
But I might not have.
The point of FedEx, as I understand it, is to make the damn connection.
You should have smelled me.
Believe me I know.
I need to do it.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the *law*! What has the law done for any of us here?
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I'm *not* a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
I'm *not* a doctor!
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
Good night, Daddy.
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Where's Mandalay?
Oh...
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Just a little privacy.
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
Nothing.
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't *ever* have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Did you know your mother better?
I don't remember.
Liberator...
What about the trees?
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Right.
What *else* could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
Obviously.
I haven't read that.
Nobody's named this one yet.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
Just promise me that, if there's a blizzard, you'll move into Wally's room until it's over.
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
The good news, Jack, is you're half- undressed for *swimmin'*...
He ain't never been outta Maine!
On me. For the seat. Cheers.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Know who I am, Jake?
Just the last three weeks.
Today? Started off great...
We'll take care of it.
So what? We hide, right?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
But you won't get that splatter effect.
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Calls?
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
We got caught. So you know it won't happen again.
No thanks. I'm good.
Was that a threat? Did I hear a threat? Last I remember, we were talking economics, then this...? What happens next time if we gotta stop and help a little old lady cross the street? Well, shit... Then we gotta pass the call to someone else.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
You're just going to have to trust me.
I don't trust anyone.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
Lily... Jesus Christ...
You sure we're clear?
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
He'll find us. We go talk to him.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
Now you're an accomplice in a homicide. Everything you thought you were in control of just flew out the window or is dripping down your leg.
Breasts.
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Thank you. Sorry, I'm just a little anxious to give it to her. You take out of state checks?
I'll find the time.
What?
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
I can handle it.
What are we gonna do with this stuff anyway? Heroin? What the hell do you do with heroin?
Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Look Special Agent Moonan... We don't know what you're talking about.
Whoa, whoa... There he is.
I'll take you up on that.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
Looking forward!
Who was he?
Don't be a spoilsport. It's only a few quid.
Not particularly.
How's that football story corning along?
I had training. In the Republic.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
I start Monday week.
Are you drunk?
Marion, stop this.
What about a drink on the way home?
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
Gambling's not about money.
Really?
Nothing about you.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
Yes, I know that.
There's a casino in this hotel.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
In the casino.
The debts.
And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.
Do you believe in astrology?
Remember the guy who cheated at the table?
But if it does.
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
No thank you.
Who...
And what do you do, Lucy?
Over the river.
Nice car.
She's my baby.
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Some other time.
Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
It was you, you shit.
We do. 
Where's the magnet?
Good call.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Remember when the artificial gravity, went out in the toilet?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Where's the fail-safe key?
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Talby, can you read me?
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Exactly.
To explode, of course.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
Hmmm...
Yeah. Eight, it says here.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
I can't talk to the others, but with time to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.
I can't seem to locate the malfunction exactly...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Well, what you might try is --
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Now that that's out of the way... You want the woman, here's how it works.  You pull fifty large out of your mattress or wherever, and I make a call to bring her in.
Yeah?
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
Security camera got you coming outta the stairwell, weapon in your hand, going to room one-oh-four and greasing the patient.  It's embarrassing to the professional community, is what it is.
No time.
Unless you wanna end up in jail, let me and Kendra handle the cops.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
You didn't...
SHHH!  Don't do that!
We're not going that route.  Sonrisa's not someone you make deals with.
Hang on, Lauren.  We're conferencing in Sophy.
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
I was expecting someone else.
How does Mrs. Eyes Only like being married to a guy on everybody's hit list?
Something.
Bent?
You're that nervous, you're welcome to stay here.
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
I'm sorry.  It wasn't my intention.  But I had to see you.
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
You did go through my stuff.
How much do you know?
And I feel real bad about all that but it doesn't mean I need to get involved.
You are involved.  By being alive you're involved.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
Look, I don't know what you want--
I think you should go now.
Right here someplace.
Then what?
You were gonna run through the law enforcement databases for a match on identifying marks.
Like you said, maybe somebody's tracking one of your investigations.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
So are dogs.
I have sincere eyes.
She's got my word.
You get it when I get her.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Does this person have a name?
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
What happens if you level with her?
Look Max, I made a terrible mistake.  One I'll never, ever make again.  Natalie and I are soulmates.  I know that now.  She's the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I guess it took the thought of losing her for me to understand that.
How'd you get her out of town?
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
She was the one--
I want you on call here.
For a change.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
Oh, screw it!
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Tell me about it. Church will never be the same again.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
Our band "Mystery" is a quartet and we can't go on the road without our drummer. Jam's mom said something about sending him to St. Bernard's, right? We gotta bust him out before we go anywhere.
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Curly.
Sure.
The easy way.
Just listen up, man, cause we are in a quandary.
Anyway, listen up. They're gone!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
She was standing right over me when I was changing for fuck's sake.
NOW!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
No...
Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
A bustier?
I had a nightmare once that something like this might happen. I hope he doesn't get grounded again. If he misses Peter Criss's drum solo, I don't know if he'll be able to handle it.
Huh. St. Bernard's. Figures it's named after a canine.
Trip, huck that out before it stains the upholstery!
Okay, I'm just a little mad now! Jam, why'd you talk us into picking that bitch up in the first place!?
Yeah.
Now that's better... but I still sense some students out there... who are AFRAID... just to say GOOD MORNING!
So... that's it?
Like a spear.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
Where did you come from?
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Wonder where we'll be then.
Will you go with me?
Yeah?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
With, like, images?
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
Well, yeah... OK, but you're not listening to me. There are other things that need to be taken into account here. Like the whole spectrum of human emotion. You're just lumping everything into these two categories... and, like, denying everything else.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
That is a terrible nickname.
Do they know yet?
I know, Dad.
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Why should I mourn for a rabbit like it was a human?
A famous linguist once said... that of all the phrases in the English language, of all the endless combinations of words in all of history... that "Cellar Door" is the most beautiful.
How so?
Do you think a lot about girls?
Yes.
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman.  She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence.  My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
What did you find?
I know.
I mean... Gretchen... She won't even let me kiss her. She says because it's our first kiss... she's, like, waiting for this big... moment or something. I just don't get it. I just want to get it over with so we can move on to the good stuff.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
How is that possible?
Soon. Time is almost up.
I was just being honest.
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
Her name is Gretchen.
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
I caught him flushing pills down the toilet. He knows you check the container.
What else?
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Oh, Kitty, I don't know. This is so last-minute... Eddie is in New York...
Let's go to Donnie's house. His parents are both at work.
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
Where is she?!
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Yeah, you betcha...
Oh-yah.
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
This came for you, sweetie.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Airport Ho-Jo!
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
I'm sorry. They're just starin'.
Okay, sweetie, that's all right. Let's go. Let's go.
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
I'm gonna be on TV! Just like Diane Sawyer.
Yah?
You hafta go home. There's some kinda emergency at the trailer park.
What?!
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
Here, have some.
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
I'll be right back. See ya later.
They told me to practice.
Wisconsin.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
You know that sometimes it's hard to understand God's great plan.
Yeah.
Uh, Gladys?
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
The king can do no wrong! 
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
Send for my car...
His Excellency's car!
We'll start a fire --  -- and get rid of these microbes.
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
Half watch dog?
Yeh, he's only got one eye.
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Why wasn't I insulted?
He's-a very easy to insult --  I say something to his niece once, and he slapped my face.
You told it to me.
I can't do it...
No. Seventy-five -- seventy-five.
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.  This is my niece Vera.
Well, why not say the least and get it over with?
You upstart!
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
No... it was a seven letter word.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
That's what I get for dressing in a hurry.
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Your Excellency, something terrible has just happened.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
This is terrible!
For you, I would do anything... 
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...
Like this. 
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
I'll show you! I'll show you!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
I intend to.
Everything will be seen to.
I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that.
You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back.
What are your plans then, Treves... You are aware that the London does not accept incurables. The rules are quite clear on that point.
Yes sir, I'll look into that.  Would you like to meet him sir?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
I don't understand.
I am very pleased to meet you.
I don't know what I've got.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
Yes!
John Merrick.
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Yes, John?
Then I shouldn't change anything?
Fine.
You're right, Mothershead, please forgive me... Of course, I appreciate everything you've done for John, and I'm glad that you are concerned about his welfare. But, I'm the physician in charge and I must do what I think best. I'm also very late, so please forgive me.
Well...
HE'S GONE!
You're losing your temper!
But you don't realize....
We blew the Horn Resounding.
It is day, of course, Freya.
Oh... well, yes, of course; it's just we're looking for the Horn Resounding and --
REALLY?
You've got to let me go!
Don't talk nonsense.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
Yes.
It's obvious you haven't raped anyone in your life.
No. It isn't rape then, is it?
I don't suppose... no...
About NOT raping you...
What about the killing and looting? That's just as crude, isn't it?
To pay for the next expedition, of course.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
I'll ask the Gods to give you life again!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Like fish.
But...
What are you talking about?
What's the matter? Are you afraid to try?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
We haven't got a spare place.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife became a Buddhist, not a Christian.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
What are you talking about?
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
That's right.
You can't let Erik do THAT.
By YOU -- Keitel Blacksmith! Don't you know, Erik, that is why he went with you? Ragnarok was good for his business...
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
Yeah.
I did. You said, things were fine.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
Okay, I guess.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
You know Wilmont?
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Um --
I don't know.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
You should stay.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Where are you going?
I love it!
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
And I didn't have an argument.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Oh.
It's freezing out here.
It's dark.
Naomi.
When?
What if?
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel --
Says you were a bully...
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Oddly enough, I do.
Your dried cum.
How's it going?
That's your look for me.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Sorry. I just --
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
It's a good one all right.
Yup.
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Can I... I brought some --
I have a family, Mary.
Yeah. Of course.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
I know who you are.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
Clockworks?
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
Easy come, easy go.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Whose fault was that?
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
For magazines?
Yep.
Tired...
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Shit! Do not do that! Where the fuck are you?
Coop, where are you...
Saw what, Mr. Cooper? What did you really see, because what you're describing is not physically possible...
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Hurry.
Oh God...
Does he know that?
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Frozen.
Peters...
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
It's 2041...
Exactly. The ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
Don't... don't do this...
Starck, give me a read.
We don't have time to fart.
Now what?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
Radiation interference?
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
I've got a theory.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I know that.
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Can you see a body?
I don't care.
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I mean...
Victor did.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
Victor must've taken him.
Ben. This is business. Just work.
We got what we wanted. That's enough.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
He's made a few changes.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah. I can tell. Victor was right.
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
Go back to the drawing board.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Oh, it is.
That's the temperature of the sun.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street. Tomorrow, who knows... maybe Washington.
Never better.
It's been changed.
You always had a way with words.  I should be getting back.
Which was?
What? What do you mean you --
Excuse me?
Anger. Rage. Frustration.
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
The plants, from space. Their particles are still charged. With the right amount of energy, those ions could create the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
You were?
Hilarious.
Sure.
Ben did this.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
I'm just guessing.
All right, then. It's your secret.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
Okay, Dennis.
Yes, sir.
Dad says!
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
I would. Yeah.
Okay. Okay.  Here's what you do.
Mark. What happened to your date?
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Okay. Thanks a lot, Linda.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
What variables?
What's the big deal?
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I think they're both virgins.
That little prick.
What do you want?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I couldn't make it in time.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
If you graduate.
The point sounds fine.
What about those other guys you live with?
Sure thing.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Naw. I don't mind.
Sure.
What's April 16th?
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
I'd like that.
Awake? What do you mean?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Well, thank you.
Crying? Why was she crying?
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Dobermans don't talk.
What?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
That's how he got so big. When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
No, no. Don't leave me!
How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy. Twenty- nine cent hotdogs...
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
What limes?
How about a check?
What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram?
Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body!
Right!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
I don't know what you're talking about!
I figure it's karma. You wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They can't get in here!  You said it yourself, they'll get in!
Right.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Fuck you too.
No. You?
Well then I guess we should just give up.
We lived near power lines.
What?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Oh.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
No, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. Just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
But --
Huh?
Huh?
Four door?
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
You smell like ass!
HOLD THAT TIGHT!
No shit.
You sure? I thought the rag had to touch?
Amazing you made it this far.
Right.
I just hit it like you said.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
You're afraid!
I'm not!
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Come here. I want to show you something.
Who is she?
Frances.
Who?
Right now we have to be practical.
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
Dick...
No?
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
...Don't you?
I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
But I gave her my word. Besides, she's still your legal guardian. My hands are tied.
Daddy!
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
They need help, Lil. They pay me back in other ways.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
Gosh! You'll break a lot of hearts.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
How'd I look?
What?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You're coming.
What's that?
I got your number, Mister Man.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
Why do you say that?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
I live here.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
You think I got it?
...You will.
Smile, little sister, smile.
Then why did you bring them?
Go on...
What's wrong?
Yes, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I will, I promise.
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all.  Okay, boys, I'm ready.
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Please sit down...
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you?  Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable...  then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Really? Any problems?
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
What?
No!
Then why weep for him?
Build for him a pyre. Light up the sky with his passing.
It can't be as bad as that.
I see it before me.
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
He needs to vent his outrage to the skies! Make yourself heard, Willie! Learning to walk is not an easy thing! Why should it be so?
Then come with me to Ingolstadt. Marry me now.
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
Only you.
...until our wedding night. When our bodies will join.
I've no choice
I'm all right. I'm safe,
I do. But you must trust me for now.
Oh God.
It's a letter to my father.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
They'll hang him all the same.
It was wrong, Henry! It shouldn't have happened! The bastard deserves to die.
That's blasphemy!
All the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
Few months perhaps. I'm gathering the raw materials even now.
A... week?
Is that your diagnosis?
You've been going round-the-clock?
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Murder Willie? In my heart, he was our child. Victor's and mine. Such a thing could never have entered my mind.
I have no knowledge of that.
Those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. Paracelsus, for one.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Despite the lack of challenge.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
There's a startling question, coming from you.  I'm captain of this ship. We sailed from Archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the North Pole.
Your men are right to be afraid.
I was careless.
I guess...
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Ned? We're gonna be working together for a while. You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
Let's go back, Barry...
We wouldn't want you thinking you're the only show-off in camp, would we?
I love you.
I don't love Neddy.
I guess...
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
You? The brick?
Mmmmmmmph.
There you are dead wrong.
Okay, Fireman.
Those things can be nasty.
But it's in the brochure! "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program." You just saw it.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
I said new, this is an '90.
He's running the show.
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
I've seen one of these before. A friend of mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck the IRS. Is that what you're doing, or are you the real McCoy?
I was a minister.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Yes.
I thought so. You help us get across the border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without trying anything funny, and in the morning we'll let you and your family go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody's happy.
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Fair enough. You break your word, I'll kill all of you.  Kate, honey!
Why not, against your religion?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
I'm like you. I don't believe in vampires, but I believe in what I saw.
In the Winnebago.
Amen.
Everybody goes home!
Okay.
Not many.
-- you got your sink --
-- see this, television!
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
We've received no news one way or the other. We can only hope for the best.
What about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
Knock yourself out.
One... Two... Three.
All I'm saying --
-- This conversation is over.
I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to El Ray and --
There's nothing wrong with me, brother. That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
We are?
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
You're lookin' green.
What do you mean?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
It don't look together.
Okay, I'll have one.
Actually, our best weapon against these satanic cocksuckers is this man.  He's a preacher.
Just some of the women.
The woman I saw you with...
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch.  My office will follow up with details.  Jumping off, now...
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Did you hear?
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Hmmm.  Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
Uh, ma'am.
Absolutely not.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige.  Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime.
'Snot me.  It's him.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Well, guess I don't even need to be here...
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
Thank you, Royce.  It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
How hard they making it on you?
Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
What about him.
That's a good story.
Smoke it!
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Sure.  Just like your men do.
I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
The first female President?
I take it this file is still open.
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
What?
Lucy'd kill me if she knew.
Sure. I'd like that.
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
I was wrong.
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
Five bucks.
Call me Charlie.
I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military...
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Follow me.
We know.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
So after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
You don't have the authority to do that.
Thanks.
Sounds like a big company.
It's the French Secret Service.
Are you sure? How do you know?
Sure.
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
It's okay. I know her.
Where are you?
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Open.
... It has been my greatest honor to serve with you.  LIving by your example these years, my life has had meaning.  I have been blessed.  Sir, I... I...
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
THIS much.
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
A boy comes to the door.
The ships are gaining...
Alex? Where are you going?
Could they be the miners?
Yes you did.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
What's  your name, son?
... But I want you to know that I am not a complete braincase, okay? I understand completely that It's just a TV show. There is no ship, there is no Beryllium Sphere, no diagital conveyor... I mean, obviously it's all just a-
It's real, Brandon. All of it, It's real.
What do you mean?
Okay, now. But-
I never get tired of that joke.
Covalent... Right. So...
Right.
I don't like this... I don't like this at all...
All right. Put me back on with him.
All right, let's all settle down.  If we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
Tell them? About...
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
Mark 12.
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
As you wish.
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
But... Inside, I have seen-
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
How about the pig-lizard?
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
I wish she was beneath me.
Don't do anything rash, please, Benedict.
I hope I never have to believe that.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
While they're strung out?
A lot of years have gone by.
That you would have known you can trust me.
I ain't forgot about the freedom.
Many of them, many did not possess proper arms.  My lord.
We've got powder but no ball!
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
Lafayette is a child!
Gag on your own invention, then.
Finally!?  It's people like these who, as soon as they get a little power, want more and more.  More ale, here!
These men have suffered but I believe they will fight.
Unofficially, General Greene.
Joseph, the British spent thousands of pounds and precious months putting together a fleet that Arnold stopped by sacrificing a heap of old barges.  In my opinion he saved my army.
Well, George, Congress just passed a resolution censuring Arnold for destruction of government property. I wouldn't cast my fate with that man.
They help me understand why we fight.
The man is a traitor!
How can you say that?
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
These supplies...?
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
What else?  From Virginia?
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Martha!  For God's sake!
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
George, I'm sorry.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
Let's get you darker!
And dost thou live to ask it?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Come here, Farrah...
You're right.
Catlett says if you don't open the locker the deal's off.
You serious? This is how you guys do business? I can't believe you aren't dead.
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
You gave him the money?
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
You serious?
Leo, I don't know.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
That's correct. Look at me.
Whatta you got there... some kinda pop nine, the fuckin' Fiat of guns, always jammin' at the wrong time.
Not yet. I just started.
What've you got?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm out here looking for Leo. I just looked you up as a favor to your dear friend, Dick Allen.
Because they're not the type of guys would take it with any degree of understanding or restraint. The first thing they'd do is break my legs.
It's not bad when you know what it's about.
So you're thinking what if I was to put you next to my dry cleaner. Ask him if he wants to invest his money in a movie.
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
That's right, they're wondering, who's this guy? You don't tell 'em. Understand, Harry? Do not tell 'em who I am.
I had to tell 'em something.
I found him.
Who?
Don't waste your time, Harry. The guy's not much of a movie fan. Now c'mon, gimme the key.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
You mean like we don't give a shit.
Yeah. Kinda. Anyway, once I have the authentic sounds of speech, the rhythms, man, the patois, I can actually begin to think the way those guys do, get inside their heads.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
I'm looking at you.
That's what I think of you, asshole. Nothing.
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
How much is the wife offered?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Yeah... that was a good scene. I mean, for a horror movie.
Man, can you scream.
Yeah. It's a real gift.  I'm just saying it'd be nice, one time in my career to get the chance to say one great line. You know, like in that Bette Davis picture, "Cabin in the..."
Not yet.
You thought I was faking?
Oh.
Yeah, Harry, you look like you belong in one of your horror movies.
Are you going down?
I don't know.
Don't worry about it. I won't say any more than I have to, if that.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What 'emotion'? Girl just got stabbed in the ear with an ice pick.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
I don't have a dog.
I'm going.
What money?
But you are interested?
Thanks.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
No.
Somebody's probably looking for her as we speak.
Bring it on, dude.
Seen a lota movies.
Are you kidding me? Jealous? Epps? Gimme a break.
If you get it back in one piece.
How long to fix?
Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending.
But how long?
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Then it happened before they scuttled her.
Not in the eyes of the law.
Why not? Why the fuck not?
Murphy.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
I don't know what you're talking about?
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Hell yeah.
No.
What?
Nope.
What guy?
You just shoot at something?
What?
Collision? With what?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Doesn't matter.
No. Someone else. A girl.  I'm not sure she was... real.
Looks like it's adrift.
Besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Lost my sea legs.
The coast guard has our last position. They'll send somebody out soon enough. A ship this size you can't exactly miss.
Government weather. It's got a transmitter aboard.
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
About what?
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
...wow...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
I figured something like that...
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Okay... I promise.
Hey Josh.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
Why?
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Oh, we totally have to.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
I can't believe it!
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
He does that every single day.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
But those are our people...
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Which one?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Nothing.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Where did you get those pants?
You don't know what you're talking about.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Hey, I was only kidding!
Really? Can I see it?
Oh, right...
I'm totally serious!
Jesus! That's very nice of you Enid but I - I really --
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Jesus, Seymour.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar...  At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Actually, it's kind of still happening... she's over here right now... I think everything's going pretty well...
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...so... is he your boyfriend now?
...I better not...
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
No, of course I do... It's just that right now I need to --
No, no... not exactly... she just doesn't understand how I would know somebody like you...
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
I hate sports.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
What?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What do you want?
But, I...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Call me sometime.
It's a tampon in a teacup...
She's not at home?
Why would she be hiding from me?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
Am I to take it you want to live?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
And it worked?
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
Every man who's ever fired a rifle has heard of him- by the time you find him, the lions will be dead.
I assure you we came close many times-
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
-you'll have to deal with it, Nigel.
Not to terrify you, Nigel, but it's worse than you think- I've never even seen one.
-true enough- but without the comedy relief. 
I'm always considerate- my mother taught me that.
I can try.
It's all right. Stay ready.  They know it's there.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
I do, actually; very much.
Hold your son high. 
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
Oh, I'm sorry.  This is Peter Venkman. Peter, Janosz Poha.
I'd rather not.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
Do you ever see him?
How is he these days?
I won't.
Thank you.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
I may have a few personal problems but one thing I am is a total professional.
You're really good, you know.
I'll put him down for you.  You are way too short!  And your belly-button sticks out!  You're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
I have a hamper?  Next time ask me first, okay.  I have more than two grades of laundry.  There're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Oh, you think so?  Well, I've got news for you.  You've got Dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  Around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  And that's just round one.
Don't worry.  We're not moving.  He is.
Tonight?
I don't think we should leave her alone.
You're right.  We should stay.
Oh, Johnny.  Did you back the wrong horse.
Yes, the scourge --
I knew that.
His nickname is "The Hammer."
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
No, the slime is rising.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Uh, I can't.  I'm kind of working on something.
Who?
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs - giga electron volts.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
No, I'm just restoring it to its normal state.
Only one way to find out.  Ready, Teddy?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
I've lived in New York all my life and I never visited the Statue of Liberty.  Now I finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
Hi, Louis.
I am Zuul.
All right, what happened to me?
Yes ... well ... I'm not sure.  What I have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
Well, let's check it out.
Are you all right?
You heard it?
Who's the stiff?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Take me now.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
That would definitely explain it.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Here are tonight's calls.
Well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... The disturbances, I mean ... But it's been quiet for years ... Up until two weeks ago ... It was never ever this bad, though.
Are you Peter Venkman?
Hey!  Make yourself useful!  Go save a tree!
That's "Peck!"
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really Biblical proportions.
Close -- but definitely wrong.
Yeah, but I didn't know you were going to give me electric shocks.  What are you trying to prove?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Were you recently in the bathroom?
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
Trust me.  It will be bad.
Some.  I just met the Keymaster.  He's here with me now.  Venkman?  Are you there?
I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  And I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
Well, I was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
It looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
Good idea.  Were any other words spoken that you remember?
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
All right.  Let's cool the negative vibes. These things can sense them.
Where are you, Pete?
Well, hurry up.  The needle's going wild.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Do you believe in God?
The whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
Maybe you should get married.  Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Do you want posters, too?
Perhaps, Master Galen, you may say.
You flatter me, Caesar.
That this illness has clouded his mind.
On what charge?
If you set me free I will find my way back to the army, march on Rome and depose you.  Then, the army and I will restore the Republic so that animals like you will never control human destinies again.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I am prepared to write anything you tell me.
The moment you returned from the battle your options were clear.  If you are a friend to neither side, legate, you must be an enemy to both.  We needed to know what you believed.
I hope you live to see what I believe...
Without him.  He'd be weeping if he overheard that.  Well?  The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
You mean a symbol of someone who doesn't exist.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Hidden.  Where my brother cannot place hands on them.  He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all.  The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
Commodus -- listen to Narcissus, listen to the man who has never lost a battle for Rome!  You're young with years ahead of you before you gain the experience to wear the purple!
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
They fear me.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Tomorrow?
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Quintus, you've got at least a division with you -- we could take Rome away from Commodus and give it back to the Senate!
Can you stop that slaughter?!  Can you free these men?
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
Then get a large cash advance.
Hello.
Yes.
No.
What?
Is anything wrong?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Don't cry. 
At the Zoo.
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
No.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
Goodbye.
What?
I might.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Tomorrow?
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Why do you have to see him?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Hello -- who is this?
Who screamed?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Right.
Ahh -- thank you.
A single. Just for myself, please.
Where is it?
Where is your luggage?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Yes.
Will you unzip my dress?
Won't you unzip my dress?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
Do you want to get it now?
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
Okay.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Oh.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
We don't.
Well how long has this been going on.
But you don't hate him.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Are you shocked?
What?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
I was just kidding around.
I have my reasons.
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
I wouldn't know.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Thank you.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Do exactly what I say.
How?
Then you'd better start believing me.
Go home now.
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
What the hell have you done?
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
No wait. Wait.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Have you thought about graduate school?
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
I know.
Oh yes.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
No, it's not --
You miss the point.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Well?
Yes.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
How?
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Why?
And then --?
So alone.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
No.
I want to be alone.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
I couldn't go through with it.  Remarkable.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
Yes.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Shall I see you again?
For Vienna?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
Why?
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Yes, quite.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
Good heavens. What for?
You're tired. I can see that.
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Do you like me better?
Then you will please wait outside.
You're a very unusual stenographer --
You're a little too fast.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Well?
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
All right.
You've decided against the merger?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
You haven't time.
What -- what is it? Last night...
But when did he go? How do you know?
Certainly, sir.
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
-- We must do something...
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Well -- gentlemen.
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
You're fuckin right you're not. How much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
My son --
Your what?
It happened once. With me, that's making a habit of it.
Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
You know it, Lilly.
I like you, too.
Hah.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
Goody!
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
No?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
Oh, sure. Fine.
You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
Oh, come on, Roy.
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
Only one tooth?
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
No. That was the point.
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Just trying to help, Lilly.
NO!
I am in school.
You called the doctor, huh?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
You already went back to work.
Working the what?
I'm a salesman.
Nobody does that single-o.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Upstate where?
That's where they keep the criminally insane, isn't it?
I went out to Delmar.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Well, let's get the shock over with.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Girl scouts.
Yeah, alright... I'll be there in ten.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No shit.
Yeah.  Oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... Goodnight.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Yes.
I borrowed it.
I guess.  It's just hard to believe.
It's always John.
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
What is it?
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Okay ... But just for tonight.
Him.
He's gone.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
I'll meet you over there.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Why did you take Jamie?
There you go trying to make sense again.  It's a curse.  Handed down through countless generations. As ageless as this celebration which you call Halloween.
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Stay away, Sam.
No one.
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
Must have changed that law.
Oh, shit.
Go home!
You're right!  We'll take a trip. A trip is what we'll take.  I don't want to talk about motorcycles.  I don't want to talk about tits.  Go home!
How about breakfast, wife?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
Sorry.
You keep on saying "deep" and "deeply." I wish something good would happen on the surface sometime.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
I wouldn't want to be married to me. We're too crazy.  You know?
You.
Anybody who'd drop an atom bomb on a city has to be pretty dumb.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
It sapped our will--made us peaceful and unenterprising.  It was a form of chemical castration. We became two more sleepy Indians.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
We got to get another pilot.
Do you know who Wanda June is?
He worships Father.
College!
She has a master's degree in English literature.
Excellent!
What's good about that?
Tell me that.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
The story gets hairier.  Should I stop?
Mhravitch.
You're supposed to get hurt!
Can't it keep till morning?
Penelope!
Damn.
No.
That's a rifle you have?
Open the bolt!
Gee whiz, Dad--
Everybody simply evaporates!  There are guest issues to be fought out here--or to be argued, at least. The enemy, the champion of all who oppose me, is in East St. Louis with his mother and his aunt!  I have so far done battle with a woman and a child and a violin.
Heaven.
Daughter--I love you very much.
My parents died in an automobile accident when I was sixteen years old.  They left me a brewery and a baseball team--and other things.  I live for a living.  I've just come back from Kenya--in Africa.  I've been hunting Mau Mau there.
Situation.
Your old beau?
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
What a honeymoon.
You're wrong.
No.
That's what you're supposed to say.
The doctor.
That's too bad.  I would rather have him at home--to see what I'm going to do.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Almost a Christmas scene.
Money?  There's plenty of that. Mildred got the brewery.  You'll probably get the baseball team.
I see.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
If you've lived a good life, fought well--
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all.  It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness.  To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
He's dead, you know.
Oh dear.
None.
What a brilliant diagnosis!
You have chills?
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Hundreds.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
We do survive, don't we?  You're going to have to apologize, of course, for calling me a bastard. That's a matter of form--not allowing you or anybody to call me a bastard.  No rush about that. Just remember to apologize sometime soon.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
I'm an honorable clown?
My violin is avenged!
I'm utterly satisfied.
You're making a mistake.  Obsolete old carnivores like me are most dangerous when wounded.  You've wounded me.
Can I beg for mercy--on my knees?
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
I dunno.
That's what he wanted--a ten-year- old wife.  He'd come home from a war or a safari, and he'd wind up talking to the little kids.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
I don't really know.
What difference does that make?  Is Dr. Woodly going to be my father now?
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I'm touched.
Good night.
We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Far as I know.
Is he coming home?
I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
I'm sorry.
He's the most wonderful guy I ever met, Penelope.  He's the most complicated guy I ever met.  I can't believe it, but he's going to take me to Africa with him.
If he is in the park, luck is all that can save him now, and there's plenty of that.
How neat.  How keen.
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Goodbye.
You're preparing him for a career in the slaughterhouses of Dubuque?  Take care of your body, yes!  But don't become a bender of horseshoes and railroad spikes.  Don't become obsessed by your musculature.  Any one of these poor, dead animals here was a thousand times the athlete you can ever hope to be. Their magic was in their muscles. Your magic is in your brains!
Yes, we do.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Keep me informed of what he's up to. You help me, I'll help you.
Yeah.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
How many weeks?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Overpowering?
The other girl is the star?
She thinks so.  What do you do?
No.
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
And your wife? Where's she?
You won't keep growing at this rate.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
No.
What do you care about?
What does that mean?  What does he do?
They believe in the 'TULIP.'
I can stop if you want.
More or less.
You really believe all that?
You wife isn't dead is she?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Where is he, Niki?
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
Who's paying you?
That's like a stag film.
They're legal now.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
They don't know. They were having some recreation deal out at Knott's Berry Farm and Kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
That's not true, Mr...?
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Where does he hang out?
Do you work for the San Francisco Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
No.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
It's a short film.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What do you think of that? Or this?
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
You working in San Diego now?
Was he with a girl?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Could I see your registration?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Check.
Where are the papers?
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
Nice to meet you.
Your hearse?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's a nice teapot.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But this is public property.
Look, the ice is melting.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
No more revolts.
Well, I don't...
I don't know.
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Yes.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
I like you, Maude.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Well, why don't you?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Yodeling?
Oh.
What is it, Harold?
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
You should have been a poet.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
Maude.
Yes.
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Well, I want you to go to bed directly after dinner. You know how susceptible you are to colds. Harold has always been a delicate child. Even as a baby he seemed to be abnormally prone to illness - Harold, dear, eat up your beets...
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
A sunflower?
At a funeral.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
None at all?
No.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
She took my head.
But wait...
I knew you'd come.
'Fraid not, baby. He belongs here. With me. We're the same. Brothers. Equal and opposite. Pure appetite. Pure banality. Too much feeling. None at all.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
No. You look...
What's the matter with her?
Hey, so for it. Don't let pity stop you. I'm down. Nail me.
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Is he serious??
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Oh, I'll bet you have.
No. It's not.
Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin --
No. It was red. Bright red.
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
He's just going through a phase --
Who wards off demons.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Oh, as opposed to -- ?
1945, you mean. Hitler died in '45.
Try not to stare. He hates when people stare.
Anung-un-Rama...
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
I think I can help -- Talk to her -- I can bring her back.
I like that...
Marco...
Who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? It's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
Not much.
It'll go in.
Got her mother's looks.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
You want it?
Some things have to be endured...
Poor baby.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Who are you?
Tell me who you are.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
Who?
Later.
Who did?
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Hi. I got soaked.
Where's Daddy?
Of course. There's no need to shout.
Oh my God.
Like who?
The best part of ten years.
No. I'm not.
So damn stupid.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
I've seen worse.
Fine.
I... suppose so, yes.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
No, not much.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
That's right.
We don't need a bed, do we?
I'll get the doctor.
Of course. This isn't a prison you know.  Look if you'd prefer to tell ME what happened, instead of a policeman --
I found a room.
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
Surprise.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
No you don't.
Yes!
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
I AM house-trained.
What do we do if there isn't?
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
What happened to you?
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
What the fuck is that?
None.  Christ!
Haven't seen it.
Liar.  We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
HELLO.  DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson?  Mr. Phil Spector?
110%.  That's my final offer.  I'm not kidding.  That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
What do you think?  Dick likes it.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
You'd love it!
Anna who?  Anna Green Gables?  Anna Conda?
What do you mean, four more?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know?  In a week or so?
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Yeah.
What's his name?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Hi.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I suppose so.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Will you please just go?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Do you want me to be there?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
What do you mean?
What do you want to do?
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Want to know what, exactly?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
You're tougher.
No use.
Ha.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
I don't know.
What's happenin'.
Is Ray going?
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Good.
So you'll stay?
That way.  You?
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Right.
Well call her mother.
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
Sixty.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
How old is Richard?
No thank you, I'm fine.
There was this one fella.  Asked a lot of questions.  I was out of town but I heard he spent near a full day in the records office.
So's playing choo-choo with two high school cheerleaders in the middle of-
Miss Cartwright, unless you have come here to sell the sword, there's very little I can help you with.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a great deal of work to do.
What the hell is going on?
Go home.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
You want me to front for you.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
I haven't killed _you_.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Thanks.
What do you want from me?
Four?
Spare me the details.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Don't be stupid, lady.  Your neck can be sliced as fast as anyone else's.
I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
Stop.
Please go to no trouble.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
Some cling to sanity through time with the one continuity and trad0 ition their lives have known: The Game.  You and I Conor, we are different from all others around us.  You know this, you can feel it.  We are flesh and bone like any man, but unlike our neighbors we are rather difficult to injure,  permanently.
You'd have to die first.  Aqui.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
But we cannot be killed.
If that was meant to be an ex- planation Mr. Romirez from Spain, I'm afraid you've failed.
I am not ready for this.
Of course.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Certainly not me.
Romirez is dust.
Finish yours?
So sure?
It can be different.  It must be.
Don't threaten me, Private.
Must he go?
We ran down that Church Hill info. She's right.  There is no Richard Taupin.
Any other I.D.s come up?
Not yet.  Called FBI yesterday. Thompson's going to try CIA this afternoon.  Y'never know.
None of this would be happening if you hadn't run...
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
How do you do it, Kahn?  How do you live so full of life for so long?
Not so long.
MACLEOD!
Leave her out of this.
Are you here?
His name was Iman Fasil if that jogs your memory.
That's none of your business.
All I need is time.
Oh yes, more than enough.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Bon jour!
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
I'm sure you haven't any.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
So long.
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
I notice you still remember it.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
I know, Walter, but I --
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
Look at this! 
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Thank you.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Huh!
All the words you've got.
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
What's that -- what's that?
You got plenty of money?
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Not this gun!
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
If there was any way out...
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you.  Who else knows about this?
What is it?
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
You'll take fifty and like it!
Phone for you, Hildy.
What's the matter? Getting yellow?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Come on with that money!
Here!
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
You don't have to go with me at all! Just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I'm concerned. Stay with that murderer you caught!
I'm quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
But how do I know...?
Is it hard?
I give that marriage six months.
You're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. Toss me up another.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Only till they get you into the local school.
Yes, she did, didn't she?
Looking for shrapnel.
I don't mind.
Sod.
Sod.
It's not the same.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
They might be.
I don't know?
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
What's left of him. He'll never see outside of the Star and Garter.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Half the time he's bluffing.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Happy days.  When you're bigger, Bill, I'll teach you the googly.
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
Happy as can be. In the old groove.
Cone.
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Baby! Stop!
Who's your Daddy!
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
That's not something to joke about.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Are you two gals all funny with each other?
You know... a couple of queers.
I just pictured the tire sitting in a chair watching TV.
Oh, wonderful.  Fucking psycho.
Fucking great.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You see me and my friends are writing a book on offbeat roadside attractions. You know all the crazy shit you see when you drive cross country.
But suppose for a second you did.
Sqeaky! No way, she ain't that hot.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
Whatever, at this point all I care about is food. I'm starving and I got a fucking killer headache.
I know, this is fucking nuts.
He won't move.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Well, ya can't complain I never take you anyplace.
I gotta open the gate.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Hmmmmm.
Yeah, I guess I'll just help him hand out candy to the trick or treaters.
He should be back in a couple hours.
This isn't everything. Get ready for this... there's a Museum of Murder and Mayhem.
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Shhhhhh.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
You got to be fucking joking.
God damn it, I knew this witch-hunt was fucking bullshit.
Recover any bodies?
Open up the trunk.
Yes, sir.
What do they call you, sweety?
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
I was just kidding.
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Excuse me, I'm sorry for disturbing you this fine afternoon.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
Please, just a minute.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Yes, sir.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
And?
And think about what you've done.
It's embarrassing, okay?
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Good morning...  We need a name for him, don't we?
Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here.
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
No. Don't be silly. It's just...
That would be good.
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Yes. Happy happy.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Gabby, what is it?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Fine.
What is it?
But I don't know how to leave Lila.
Hi. It's Nathan.
No!
That's not how he tells it.
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Always. Ow.
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
Won't he be able to tell?
Be still my crotch.
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Rose, please go away.
Yeah, although I'm not going to turn him in. I like hearing the dirt.
No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
How's it going?
I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded.
You do?
Why certainly!
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle?
Your entire body?
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Of course not.
Do you like my new look?
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Such as what womanly things?
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
Should I come with?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
Right.
You know what's good for him?
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Oh, about five hundred.
It's possible.
Deal.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
You being cute?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
I told you. I got drunk.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
Man named Turk Baker?
What happened to you anyway?
I been thinking.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
How good is he?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
Where?
I said we're leavin'.
You want me to tell her for you?
Tell her what?
Fifty per cent?
What kind of straight pool game you like?
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
Aw, Eddie.
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Glad to meet you.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
By all means.
Yeah, sure has.
Gimme ten bucks.
Ten dollars.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Okay, friend.
Shoot.
Heads.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
What bus?
Cramped.  You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No. I'll take you home.
Raw.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
He knows. A lot.
Well, he owns things.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
For how long?
Oh, grow up.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I'll be up later.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
My name is Robert.
Do you want to go on?
It comes back.  Flashes.  My name.
Dark and large.  With vines -- no, not vines.  Not alive.
Where you lived with them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
If I'm a hunter it's because you taught me to be!
You know what I mean.
Have you always had it?
Yes.
Humans.
That's the Air Force Base.
There's Cassius ...
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
He was upset with moving, I believe.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
We were having a little talk.
Of course.
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
All their lines were busy.
We can't do this alone.  We've got to get help.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What happened to your other slipper?
Gardner?  Oh, um -- he's a new student. Just moved here.  Why?
It's not paranoia. The embedding is very subtle. It's probably been overlooked...
A toast to the end of the world.
I wanted a career. Didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
All you need is love. John Lennon. Smart man. Shot in the back, very sad.
Started this morning. Every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. Snow, static, all kinds of distortions. No one knows what the hell is going on.
So sue me.
Please, would I be this panicked if it was that simple?
What's the bad news?
Haven't you been watching?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Checkmate.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
That's okay. You're driving.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
I'm making a mess.
A cold? Of course.
We'll meet you there.
She should be shortly.
Yes, Sir.
But what, General?
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It's doing what?
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Butt-munch.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Air... water... your "sun."
Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
And I am his.
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Alexandretta. Now we know.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
Got lost in his own museum, huh?
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
Mine, too.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
You do.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Thank God!
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
There were rats, Dad.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
All right, move! Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
Head for the fireplace!
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
What happens at eleven o'clock?
Get out of there, Dad!
Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
That was a misunderstanding.
At last I have the ashes of my sacred ancestor!
Step on it, Short Round!
Okey-doke, Indy! Hold onto your potatoes!
Okay, Shorty.
Just a statue.
Yeah, that's what happened...
Nobody's perfect. The way I heard it, you stole one of them from a small village.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
I don't understand. What's happened here?
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
Their children?
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a better idea.
Can you move your arm?
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Pet it on the head! Go on, pet it!
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that!
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
I am -- it looks horrible!
It's a Thuggee ceremony. They're worshipping Kali, the goddess of Death and Destruction.
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
They don't cry about you. They cry about the elephants leaving.
Figures...
You're not gonna believe this...
Al.
Yes.
Where are we? We're on the street. We're walking down the street. We're talking to ourselves. People are staring at us.
I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
Then I'm crazy.
You're gonna explain.
Why he's argumentative?
Well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
We have to get out of here.
With Authority!
Where are we going?
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
Gone where?
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Nothing!
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
What about it?
Oh yeah, to what?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
It's sand.
.
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
But, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
That's a big if.
Are you serious?
How do you know?
Maybe she's telling the truth.
This just won't work.
Not her. You!
Oh, you were right. They've all been here before... met just last week.
You get time off to sleep.
Why don't you get out of my face.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Run, stupid!
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Don't worry!
You were with GRUNER!
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Aim what?
I have been... I think you're right.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
Who's our little man?
Surveilliance on them all.
We're here.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
I will?
What?
Take the card.
What did you say?
You did. JOE No I didn't. You said   something first.
...I'm looking for someone.
Yes, of course.
Me still. They left you alone?
I waited for you.
...and sort of...disinterest.
I am sort of scattered.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why do you do it?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Why'd you run off?
What did you tell them?
There's not much to tell.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
We're very close.
What is it?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Beats me.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
They asked about you.
Why did you, then?
Why not, what are you going to do?
Escape.
I knew it. I told him.
We just don't stop.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
That's twenty feet high.
He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
I know a nice island.
...Piece of mind.
Why'd you invite me here?
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Thanks.
Could I have it, please.
Yes.
Thank you.
Perfectly.
Poor bastard.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Three hours.
What? Forget it.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Good.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
I'm not touching my film...
No, I'm not...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Come again?
Call me back in ten.
Why?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
Where should I wash them?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
Let me call you back...
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
I have to take a shower.
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
Alright?
After we corroborate it. That's why we've never lost a lawsuit and run a classy show.  Anything else?
Oh, lots.
Oh, how fortunate I am to have Lowell Bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. To show me the way.
Because I think Hezbollah is trying to broaden into a political party right now. So you care about what you're thought of in America. And in America, at this moment in time, Hezbollah does not have a face.  That's why.
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Good. I want to talk to you.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...
Okay, so, here you are... you go to work for tobacco.  You come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. You go to tobacco... Tobacco is a sales culture. Market and sell enormous volume. Go to a lot of golf tournaments. The hell with everything else.  What are you doing? Why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?
You charge by the hour?
No.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
No.
What kind of shit is this? I was not on the team, I sparred with the Olympic Team... okay?
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
You try and have a good time.
Yeah. Yeah, I will.
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
You're saying that Brown & Williamson manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix, not by artificially adding nicotine, but by enhancing the effect of nicotine through the use of chemical elements such as ammonia...
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Yeah, there are times I wish I hadn't done it. There are times I feel compelled to do it. If you asked me would I do it again? Do I think it's worth it? Yeah, I think it's worth it.
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
After you, Doll.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
You have the pre-nup?
Huh?
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Isn't everything?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
And you've always loved him?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Oh Miles!
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
Fabric and fringe.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I want to nail you ass.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Those are gifts.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
It's not something I wanted either.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
I wish I had your discipline.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
Heh heh.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
I don't know. I can assume...
Well -- is that possible?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Nothing.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
She owes me a meal.
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes sir. If you'll excuse me, sir—she sent me for a drink.  Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door.
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted.  Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami—  for the love of it?
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand.  When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century!  What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day—whether it's coming to her or not.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Oh, no.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Is that his name?
Been sending her meals in regularly?
You've made that quite evident—with all your threats of annulment.  Well, it hasn't bothered me for a minute. Ellie and I got married because we love each other. And she's proving it; as far as I'm concerned there's going to be no annulment.
We've done that already.
Amateurs!
But it's King Westley on the phone.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Driver!
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
I found it on the seat.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
That's none of your business.
You're on a budget from now on.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Not at all. 
Listen, Brat—I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
Where is the shower?
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
Santa Claus?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
What do you mean—starvation?
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
What!
But what!
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Uh-huh. Want one?
Oh, no!
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
You! Don't make me laugh.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Eat a carrot.
What'd you give him for the car?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Not interested. 
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
Isn't he here?
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Get out!
Oh, excuse me. 
Eight o'clock.
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Huh?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles. 
What's the thousand bucks for?
Huh?
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
For heaven's sake, Joe—stop being an editor for just a minute.  We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Yeah, where am I?
Well, you got one now. —Come on, fill 'er up.
Yeah?
Blamed if I know. I just brung 'em a trumpet.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub of—of—"
Collect.
Yeah. Come on—come on!
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with—
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
No.
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on.  You're a goddamn spy.
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Frank, I don't want to hear it.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
You, Numa?
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
I told your uncle I never met a lawman who wasn't a punk.  You too, Bill, even if you're family.  He's a big shot businessman.  I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots.  A fag, you know.  Goes by another name down here.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
I see... and why are you experiencing this paranoia?
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
Well that must've been mistaken information we got.  Thanks for straightening it out for us.  There is one other matter that's come up, Dave.  We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly after the assassination of Friday.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Why Galveston?
Dave, can I just ask you this directly?  Did you ever work for the CIA?
And Shaw?
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
I had the cause of death.
If that's your case, you didn't have a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever Habighorst said, anyway.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
No.  Never heard of him.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you?
No, people like you don't have to, I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops.
Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government.  I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
Huh?
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
We're going back into the case, Lou - the murder of the President.  I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people.  Bill, I want you to get Oser on the medical, the autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories, tax records...
Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
It never did. 
Was he there often?
Nonsense.  You should be in a job where you can make decisions that have impact, affect the world.  Here you're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest.
I am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch.
Oh, that's not a problem.
But you didn't ask permission. You broke a trust. If you had asked, Karen probably would have let you. I'm sure she would.
You.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
What'd ya mean?
Uh-huh.
How'd you know where he was?
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
I'm not saying another word.
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
That's my diet shit.
Why does it need to be dark?
What's your brand?
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Ordell pick up his bond?
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
Cash poor?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
Uh-huh.
The Delfonics.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
It's very possible Ordell's killed somebody.
It's not really something I think about.
Really?
No...  ...I don't believe she's ever heard of me. But that doesn't mean we're not going steady.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
No harm in that. He's a young guy havin' fun being a cop. I know the type, trust me on this. He's more interested in Ordell than the money. If he's gonna do anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction; but he wouldn't walk off with the money. It's evidence.
What about you Max?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
Yeah, that night I went to pick up a guy. I hear he's staying at this house, so I sneak in, wait for him to come home.
Uh-huh.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Do you think they bought it?
Where's the rest of it?
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Everybody wants him, he's a homicide suspect. It doesn't matter who brings him in, he's gonna name you as an accessory.
It's not that simple.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
I thought you were tired of your business?
He say is a surprise.
Can I smoke?
What are you doing?
I imagine shit needs to be done.
What's her story?
And splittin' with her?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I never have. It's not my money.
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
That would be one point of view.
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
I told them.
I don't know. One of your friends.
Yeah, I think a woman.
But you don't?
That's the idea.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I can do that.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Four years?
What for?
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
It's a diet thing?
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
No thanks.
Yeah.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Where were you?
We had done time together already.
Did you ever go I one?
You been to Japan?
Must of made quite an impression.
Yeah.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Go in there, snatch her by the hair, and drag her big ass out. This is my goddam money we're talking about. Get your ass out the door.
Not now, pick me up.
I shot her.
In the chest and stomach.
Well, if you had to do it, you had to do it. What we don't want is that bitch surviving on us. Anybody but that woman.
Where's the rest of it?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
How long was she in there?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
It's in there.
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
C'mon, you know how they do. Black man comes in with ten thousand, they wanna fuck with 'em. First off, they gonna wanna know where I got it. Second, they gonna keep a big chunk of it -- start talkin' that court cost shit. Fuck that shit, Jack. I'll go through you.
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
The bond for possession is only a thousand.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
In a way, yes.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
That I gotta see.
If she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody right now. When you said you'd name her as an accessory she believed you. That scares her more than anything.
I know where to turn.
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Let me speak to Max Cherry.
He leave town?
Dead? No. I just hurt my back. I'm not dead.
What do you want?
Just to see you. That's all.
Like Della.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
Oh God!
Stop!!!!
What do you want from me?
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
Oh, terrific.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
What do you mean?
I'm hanging up.
I'm too messed up to teach.
Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
Used you?
Shit!
I know you. How come you're so tense today?
What can I tell you?
I saw Sarah the other day.
She says she can't get them new coats because you haven't sent the alimony for three months.
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
I had to get in there. A deep adjustment. Rest a moment and let it set a bit.
Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
I'm walking, aren't I?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Carlson? Is he new here?
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I thought you said it was a nightmare?
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Gee, thanks a lot.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
I don't let anybody call me that.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
What?
When was the last time I said a word?
Oh, come on. It's early.
We're at Della's.
The numbers stop at 107.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
Get your clothes off!
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
Here. I'll do it.
Jezzie?
I want to know. You tell me!
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
I have no idea.  I was right. There were experiments. I knew it. I knew it. My God.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
What's gotten into you?
Bullshit!
Please.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Mid-town mostly.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Don't be funny.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
You know who I am.
No shit. They had me by the balls. Next thing I know I'm in Saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. Not the street stuff mind you. They had us isolating special properties. The dark side, you know? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
Yeah, sure. We were losing the war.
A couple of days later. It was fierce. You guys never saw it.
Pleasant dreams.
Just relax.
I'm sure. You've got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
I don't know what to say.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
For what? For seeking the truth?
Paul Gruneger!
Nothin' much.
I need to see you.
No joke. Fuckin' army! That goddamn war. I'm still fightin' it.
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
You've seen them?
Me, too. I had no idea. It's like I was coming apart at the seams.
A car accident.
How did it happen?
He doesn't like it.
Oh, come on!
If the ship goes, so does Jaso.
We made it?
Rizzo did.
The hull's imploding!
Two more charges to go.
I am an expert!
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
My job.
Negative.
I'm pulling, damnit!
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
Eat me.
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
I've waited long enough. Kay . . . you know what to do.
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
We're screwed.
Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
NO!
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you.
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
Get him out of there!
You're crazy!
Sure, Dad.
Here --  Take him home.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
And incidental damages, if any...
You got it.
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
He's taken him!
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
So we should set out a smorgasbord?
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
Yeah. Rogue. Picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?
Our friend, the shark.
How can you tell?
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
A White! A Great White, I found a tooth buried in the hull. He must've attacked... I knew it... Gardner's dead in there. I didn't see the mate...
It's a whale out there.
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
And nobody else saw her in the water?
I'm responsible for public safety around here...
I can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. This is really dumb. This isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.
Yep.
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
25 feet. And three tons of him there.
Nothing! A pleasure scar. Look here --
Thanks for the message.
You know how I feel about her.
Cool.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I don't like Katrina.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
What?
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Yes they are, Josh. Since Mankato, they have been lying eyes.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Yeah.
'93. I'm telling you that was the best time for rock and roll.
You weren't even alive!
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Here's to dovetailing interests.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Go learn something.
Is Vanessa here?
Nope. We're safe.
Hilarious. No, I just keep all of my old comics down here, and I want to show you one of them.
A baby is not going to fix everything. Besides, I don't know if I'm ready to be a father.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Oh really?
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
Yeah, she does.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Yeah, like people in love.
Dad, no!
Please stop now.
That is sick, man.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
What?
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Eww, he's all beardy!
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
And I disagree.
...I said, I like your hair.
No it is not!
...Anything else?
...That's not true.
Almost.
Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
Walter Livesy.
Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think...
Yeah?
Two brothers, prospectors, lived here. Up until a few years back.
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Look again!
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Not yet.
Nervous?
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for?
...Janitor's job.
Yeah.
Let me smell it again.
How?
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it. But I wasn't gonna try. The whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. Show 'em some respect.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
Did she suck your dick?
It's no big deal, right?
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
I know what you mean.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Shut up.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Shut the fuck up.
Why not? You stink.
That shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. I like my odor. It's fuckin' natural.
Casper, where's Telly.
Where you at?
Where you goin' tonight?
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
At the block party?
Sure. I even thought about you when I woke up.
Yeah?
Come on.
How do you know?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Oh man. You gotta see this. It's a spectacle. A real spectacle.
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
I wouldn't believe it?
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Foreplay. Foreplay.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
It's like yeah whatever. But when you fuck. You wanna fuck that person. You're like ripping each other's hair out. Ooooh.
Yeah.
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
Oh god. That's horrible.
Shh.
I'm gonna go out for a little while.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
I don't know, eight or nine.
Where does everyone sleep?
It's grandmother style.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
I think you're lying.  That's what kind of problem.
You are!  I don't like you.
You like to play games, don't you, Peter?
Oh, we'll be back.  You can bet on it.
No.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
Get off me!
Local?
I've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. Yurilivich?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
I haven't got time for this.
To get your attention.
Then call them!
By that time the game will be over.
No you haven't.  And even if you had it doesn't matter.  Who would you tell? The police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
Very good.  How did you know?
No problem.  We're in.
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
Yeah.
Anything else?
Meaning?
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
About a quarter to one.
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
"Wee Willie Winkie runs though the street."  We think he might be making a reference to himself.
A building isn't as light as air. What's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
That's got to be it.
He knows you're aware of that.
Just thought you might want to talk.
About what?
I can check and call you back.
Thank you.  I'm at 639-7393.
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
What are they, please?
It's alright.
When I was very young.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
She could be dead after the game.
You sound like my mother.
Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
Of course.
It's alright.  It was a long time ago.
It must've been very hard on Erica?
It was.
Nothing.
No he didn't.
Are you going to come tonight?
Yeah.  I'll be there later.
I'm sure you are.
Me too.
Last night was the worst. I dreamt you had one leg shorter than the other, and walked like a penguin.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Thank you, but I can wait.
About what?
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
Does the Queen live?
In the old books. It's called a glaive.
You have rope?
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
No. They occupy the Fortress, but they cannot control its movement. It is moved by Fate. And, sooner or later, Fate will place it near us.
You have not slept in two days.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
But you suspect.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
What business?
I have need of friends.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
They do not exist, except in the waters of the Swamp, where they will remain.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Tonight and every night, my friend, for this is the second time you've saved my life.  I am Ergo the Magnificent, short in stature, tall in power, etcetera, etcetera.
You do?
You can have half.
Smart lad.  Bring me my spices!
Not working? This nose? This nose works day and night. This nose has never loafed an hour in its life. This nose ...  What?  Impossible. This nose asleep while venison fills the air?  Where is it, boy? Tell me where it is and I forgive you everything.
No, no. I'm with you, boy.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It is the time.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
It is no trickery.
Of what?
Then the other Lyssa will share your fate. She will grow old in the Fortress as you have grown old here.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
...Good...  But what's special in him?
...Not at all.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
Whoever.
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
What?
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...Later.
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
Mathilda, listen!
I have no fear.
Ten dollars... A month.
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
I know... But I'm a little pressed.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No... Dino's.
No...
Uncle Maurice -- I spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... I have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  Come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we'll plan a car trip across the country -- Gerald and I will come along --
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Put out a P.B.S.... Or whatever it's called.
No, I just don't want anybody dying because I didn't say something when I had the chance.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
No.
Show me.
Don't be so sure.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
Jumped where?
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Making the grand total?
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
Tomorrow.
What Mr. Parker?
... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me?  To tell me you know what's best?  To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
Where am I?
He's getting my sweater from the car.  I said there was a breeze.  I told him not to go.
Yes.
Evening News?
It's yours.
This is my only chance to get a watch like that.  It would mean a lot to me and my family.  Please take it.  It really isn't that much.
Non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...Noooo.
Water?
Hello.
Are you working?
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Don't be silly?
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
We?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
I was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
I will keep you safe. We are both older.
I am lonely, Yuri.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
You understand you're on trial for murder?
Uh, yeah, because the bitch shot him.
No. I was in the shower.
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
Huh?
He's gay -- he isn't Brooke's lover! He's making it up. Whoever killed Heyworth is paying him off.
Is everything okay?
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
So everything you just said --
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt.
What could I do?  He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
No.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
What?!
Josh proposed!
Not yet.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
But maybe it is --
Because people aren't always what they seem to be and you refuse to see that. Have a little faith. You might be surprised.
And you know this for a fact?
Fine. Sorry I brought it up.
What if you're trying to be something you are? The hell with Donovan. Stay.
Are you asking me on a date?
Where's Warner?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
I'd rather have a client who's innocent.
I don't know --
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You know -- mixers, formals, beach trips.
So are you!
I completely agree.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
I mean, I know you're upset and all, but can't you just take a sedative?
Then we smash 'em?
Fire moat... why do that?
Purely a precaution...
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
I like well what I see.  It pleases me.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
And then?
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
And, now?
Cathay?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
You come stealee tleasoo?
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
What do I do?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Bravely spoke.  You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
Good plan that.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Certainly understandable.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Willful creature, that one...
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
What magic have we on our side?
Fire away!
Aye.  We're good as inside.
Can you save her?
Sunlight, you say?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
I could have struck off his head just now!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it.  Said she'd marry me if I did.
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Unicorn?
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
What?
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
Ask away, sweet man.
No!
You'll visit again?
I pray God grants it me.
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
Only that?
How so?
And sweet?
Please...
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
You're well equipped, I'd say. Legendary arms...
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
To Castle Couer de Noir?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there.  Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
In a dream.
Sam!
It's so beautiful.
I would have anyway.
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
I couldn't sleep last night.
He seems lonely.
Why?
Monday.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
I don't know.
I can't even take a shower here.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I might not stay, anyway.
Really?
I'm okay.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
Why are you so uptight?
What are you talking about?
Not really.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
He buys and sells the world.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
Uh huh.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
We're getting out of the ground today.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
And you thought they might be under her dress?
Why would you be there?
I'm not going!
I'll get your bag.
Get the inkling, Sam.  I'm getting tired of your attitude.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I can promise you complete privacy.
I don't know.
When are you going to be back?
I don't know.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know.  Why?
I like how it feels not to feel.
What I'm not.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Can you build a house in four months?
Do you know what I'd give to have this! Forget how I got it!  I can't afford dirt in this town.  I live in Riverside, Goddammitt  And you get to piss in the ocean.
Oh.  Sorry.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Where he always is.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
But you can't call me while you think?
I wasn't thinking.  Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
I love those doors.
The garage.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
You're not well.
I smiled at him.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
I'd rather you not be here.
I can hire workers to help me.
Going on?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before.  It's habit.
You got the money?
I'd be you.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Do you like red?
Hey.
This is what he wants.
I just thought it would be nice.
Can we really help build a house?
Dad's home, already?
And the baby?
Hell with him. It ain't that.
Is Spanky here?
I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
I'll be right back.
Sure, boss.
Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check?
A job, huh? Well, that's nice, real nice. You won't have to work long. I'll be back soon enough. After I start work at First Federal Bank of Manhattan, I'll be keeping you in style. Everything will get back to normal again. That's a promise.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
That's right, a loan officer.
Like this?
My daddy gave me this watch.
I call it like I see it, and what I see is definitely soft.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Still got that ten dollars?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Oh, man, I've never seen a dead body before!
He does it all by himself.
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
I said you're soft.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
How the fuck are we gonna do that, Ray?!
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You get ketchup?
Him?
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
I'm not in the mood right now, Ray.
Maybe you're fooling yourself, Ray. Maybe you're just a chip off the old block.
Well, if that's the way it is...
Bullets weren't the problem. That pie was too hot. Burned my tongue.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
You didn't think I was gonna let you escape alone, did you?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
Never thought I'd hear Ray Gibson say that. Hell with you then. You'd only slow me down anyway.
Well, not yet. It's still in the planning stages.
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Tell him the state of Mississippi is only interested in getting this ditch cleared by sundown.
Just because it's in my mind, Goldmouth, don't mean it ain't real. Everything worth anything starts with a dream.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
What were they, bootleggers?
I gave you life. And they can't take it away from you. Remember that. You'll get outta here someday. I believe that. You gotta believe it, too.
He must still be in there.
You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City, but down here we take murder seriously.
Like you shot Winston Hancock?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Satchmo.
Me? Willie Long.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
I just want somebody who won't put a bullet in my back once the truck is full.
How about this? I stay here enjoying my Schnapps and you go back.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
...their damned souls will be ours.
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
I was going to let you out, eventually, Cassius. I swear.
Show him Central Park.
My mom wasn't a goat?
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky.  You get your ass back up there. You save your father!
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
Coulda been much worse.
Beast.
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
No.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
Yes, great movie...
All right...
Really?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
I feel sorry for you, boy!
Shut up! Shut up your damn mouth!
And I did it myself right on there.
Just the face.
Hurry... hurry... hurry.
Dunno... flameout maybe. Whatever happens, you can bet it's final. But who would want to find out?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
I never even visited Nursery before tonight.  When you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
What an old, old man you're getting to be, Francis. Weren't you ever a Yellow? I bet you were even wilder than --  come on, Sandman.
Please... No.
You felt sad. What's your name?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
But you put yourself on the circuit!
Why is it wrong to run?
Of course.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why tell me?
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
How can I?
That's nice.
Uh-uh.
Let's see -- how long has it been?
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
Yes, but they won't know that... or care. They're hunting you, Logan. Maybe me too, now...
He's good, isn't he?
How will they know we're coming?
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
For us.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Beloved wife...
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I like your face. Would you mind if Doc took a picture? I'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Good... You up for a drive?
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
I forgot. Anyway, I hate the idea of acting paranoid.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
If anything else happens, you'll call us.
So what do we do?
I don't know.
What's he do?
Yeah. Call him.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
Sit down a minute.
No.
You talk to him?
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
At your house. Don't you remember?
Who's it from?
What night?
I thought there might be somebody inside.
Was there?
No... of course not.
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
That's good, Pete. Hey... I want you to talk to a friend of mine.
What?
You were acting like a different person.
I don't want to talk about it...
Sheila?!
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
Oh, read it!
I'm a paleontologist.
When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
Oh, really?
Yes!
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Please don't call me Lovey.
No kidding?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Mr. Chang - High Lamas or Low Lamas, do we get the porters?
Say, what about that gold deal?
No.
Oh, that's a cinch. I'll show them how to cast pipes out of clay.
You mean you don't want to go?
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
You've no idea, sir, how unexpected and very welcome you are. My friends and I - and the lady in the plane - left Baskul night before last for Shanghai, but we suddenly found ourselves traveling in the opposite direction—
Thank you.
How about law and order? You have no soldiers or police?
Oh, good heavens, no!
Well, it must have taken–
Buy and - sell? No, no, pardon me, exchange .
The only one.
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
No.
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
Father Perrault is dead.
Aren't you afraid to leave? You don't want to look like an old woman, do you?
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Do you think this will come in my time?
Yes.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
I don't know. I can't get the dialect.
That's what you said.
Nothing about the porters yet?
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
What if he refuses?
It might afford you a great deal of relief.  Now gentlemen, I'm going back to sleep. Oh, and I was having such a peaceful dream.  As soon as he lands, let me know.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Yes.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
Because mother read it in a book somewhere, and if mother's little darling doesn't take her fingers out of the salad bowl this instant, mother's going to wring her little neck.
I'd love it!
Forgiven.  You know, when we were on that plane, I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it. That silly shadow racing along over mountains and valleys, covering ten times the distance of the plane. It was always there to greet us with outstretched arms when we landed. And I've been thinking that somehow you're that plane, and I'm that silly shadow. That all my life I've been rushing up and down hills, leaping rivers, crashing over obstacles, never dreaming that one day that beautiful thing in flight would land on this earth and into my arms.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
You'll wait till you rot!
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
It's not even a fucking door.
No-- it makes sense.  Cause I gotta tell ya, when I was in third grade they told me I was crazy cause I swore that our teacher was from, like, Venus or something.
What happens if I say no?
It'll make sense later?
No. But You'll get used to it.    Welcome to the Men in Black.
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
What?  I thought you just--
She didn't even know you. .
Let's see... that was second gear..Kay shifts into THIRD.  Jay winces.
There's a god damn good reason.
You think that's what's-happening?
Get back in the car!
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Kay.  All I'm saying--
Do his job.
Right.  Oh, and here.
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
Exactly.  I very much enjoy that.
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
You're not taking me in!
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Come on now.  People are smart.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They haven't announced it yet.  All I know is we're in motion for the most watched media event in history.
That's why you have doors, Mr. President.  Keys, however, are to lock the doors.  And locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  Why? Fear.  You humans are afraid.  So you set up boundaries.  Borders. Your car.  Your home.  Your country.  All the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  Well I am here to let that enemy go.  Because there's a border you didn't even know existed.  It's the border to the Universe.  And unlike your other borders, you humans didn't set this border up to keep other planets from you.  It was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  Until now.  Because I have been sent here to open the door.  To present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
A good question.  And a simple answer.  No more hunger.  No more smog. No more overpopulation.  No more war.
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
He'll turn around.
Anderton, leave.
What is it?
Agatha, you're never going back there.
Just some guy... they found.
That's comforting.
I know that, but I wanna keep the old ones.
Tell you what, since you and I go way back, I'll give you my Old Pal discount.  How's that sound?
Yes, you did.
Kill type?
Try again.
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
In the middle of the night?
No?  How's an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?
This is all Witwer.  He's setting me up.
All right, John, just take a breath, let's think about this...
I can't.  They're following me right now.  They'll meet me there. They'll halo me.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Now look at him...
Did Marks close the front door?!
They did.  Make yourself comfortable.  We'll be back in an hour.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
So I'll be the first one to go in then?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I guess that's all of it.
Wanna hear something funny?
I lived for a year with a man who was pretending to be my father.  He took me all over the world.
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
Why?
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
You look great.
He also said Crow was a fake.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
How?
Nothing.  No footsteps coming up the stairs.  No hovercraft out the window.  No clickity click of little spyders.  No one crashing through that door.  And do you know why I don't hear any of those things, Danny?  Because right now, the Precogs can't see.
Nice to meet you.  Gum?
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
Yes, I know.
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
What kind of cop were you before this?
Who?
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
I'd love to, but I've got an open house today at the Ressler place.
Sure.  Raincheck.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
No.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
What's 'incidentals?'
Phone, room service, mini-bar. Any additional expense. If you need anything you can push the button marked 'Concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
Is it the good room?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
We're in Fashion.
Look at, ladies. I could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. But I feel what you guys are putting out there. I'm only a mirror reflecting what I'm getting from you. And I'm saying yes to it. I'm shaking hands with it. I see the road that you're pointing down and I'm saying I'll ride shotgun. And when your foot slams on the accelerator, I won't get scared. I'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. With my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'Faster, Billy! Faster! Drive faster! Faster yet -- !'
He's alright.
Will you paint the damn thing. Why do you gotta be such a baby.
Mommy's not home?
I love you. Come home.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
I feel weird asking him.
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
I'll support you.
I don't get it.
Get away from her.
So, when's the drop.
A Shot Caller. A boss, a Capo. He's running shit.
Where's Ricky.
It's fixed. That's the only way to win. A sure thing. See that horse. The blaze.
Pshhh...
No.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
Take a few days --
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
We get it. We're sorry.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Understand me?
So, it's not a winning record.
That's not what you said. You said if you didn't have a winning record --
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Shit. Who we kidding? I know I suck, and I held you up for ten rounds --
I'll beat your ass --
Some Mexican? How much could he weigh? A buck fifty, tops? I'd kick his fucking ass.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
She really liked the kitchen.
I don't want to show up hammered. We're supposed to be representing Max.
Oh, I'll represent alright.
No. Look. There.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Great. On my fucking room.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
Don't even start.
No. Tell me. What's so fucking horrible about this gig? You've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on Maxie's list, and here we are.
About what?
Why you gotta make everything difficult?
Fine.
We're not getting whacked.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
You see a Ricky Slade?
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Show me. Show me where it says Screech on the fucking list.
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
It's in your copy of Hemispheres. I believe it's Mickey Blue Eyes.
Ugh...
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
You strapped?
It means you got a gun?
Stop.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
No?
Well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Brilliantly. Care for a pint?
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
Nah, man...
Word.
You'll love it.
But, Max --
We're square.
Unless spoken to, ain't that right, Horrace. Didn't you say that?
So, you must be the Red Dragon.
Heard where?
I like you, country.
Why?
What?
Nnnnnnn!
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
Then skip it, man. But you slipping, baby. You done slipped.
That really you, Red?
Man, what do you want?
You need something. It's not a reefer, but it'll help some.
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Let it burn. Maybe you'll hear me then.
I ain't never seen a cat like you. Ain't you scared talking like that in front of an ofay?
Don't con me.
I told you to go behind the words and dig out the truth. They let us sing and dance and smile -- and now they let one black man in the majors. That don't cancel out the greatest crime in history. When that blue- eyed devil locked us in chains -- 100,000,000 of us -- broke up our families, tortured us, cut us off from our language, our religion, our history.
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
I can't.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Next week, Brother Minister.
She ate.
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
What?
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
How old are you, Betty?
I know.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Dear heart, I love you.
That's enough, Brother Earl.
Let's get out of this cold.
Entirely.
What?
"His greatest greatness."
Did you hear me?!
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
No. You'll be marked for death.
You better believe it.
What's your story, baby?
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Make it too easy and it ain't no fun.
Eat lead, coppers.
Naw, you missed me, copper. Try this on for size.
Man, the name musicians ain't got shit. How you gonna have something? I need a stake, a bundle, a grand. My woman can't afford it; my homey ain't got it. How about you baby? What you got?
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says you should pay it all your mind. If you got a mind.
Might be, shit. Man, I know this town. I got my own fences. Who the hell are you? Who put you in charge?
That's right.
All these photos you just saw were of policemen. Sadly they're protected. La Hermanidad. The brotherhood.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
I'm not... easy.
[South America.]
[Why?]
How do I contact you? We still don't have the ATM info.
[Daniel.]
[Aurillio Rosas Sanchez.]
[Do you know who I am?]
[It's all up to you, commandante. Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer'.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
Nine millimeter. A Sig Sauer 226.
How does it affect you?
And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Maybe...
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
The United States.
I know. But which state?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
No.
Everywhere!
My ankle.
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
No, that was in Columbia.
Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Still not a question.
You think too much?
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
Because...  I was already dead.
An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity.
Last night. Do you know something?
Camila. Camila Valencias.
Don't forget your towel.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[A beautiful circle.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
You and Creasy both. A two man army according to Interpol. Panama. Lebanon with the Druze. Desert Storm. Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders.  You two were a married couple.
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
It must be one o'clock.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
I feel fine.
You told me.
It pains that they should do this.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
Yeah.
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yes, I know.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
No...
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
What?
I'm just gonna get my cigarettes. I left them in my coat.
Well, at the time she told me this, she already had six. Every time I saw the woman, she was either...
I never thoughta that.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Sure. Thanks a lot about my mother. We'll work out some arrangement, because naturally I want to pay...
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Sure.
She didn't look Italian to me.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
Well...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
Tommy...
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?!!
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
I don't care about the intention. I just know your Cross Action is a plus on our side. I've seen it come through four times.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
I have been in this Army a long time. I know just what you guys are up to. But there are limits...
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
That's right.
Look at that right eye.
Epidural hematoma?
Crabapple Cove. Maine.
We sure don't aim to cause any trouble... Yeah, she seems to grow on you.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy.  You're a witness.
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
Like the Spearchucker said, that's possible. Anyway, it's been an interesting association.
We're a good team.
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
Obviously you don't think so, and I don't know why.
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
You want it straight? Medical history records no instance of anyone taking this particular prescription and surviving.
Dartmouth's too big and too expensive. If he's as good as I think he is, he can move into the big league later. But Androscoggin first.
We'll need room. The sixth rib goes.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We may be in trouble, I can't catch my breath. I've got the occupational disease of oversized ex-athletes.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
But I'm married.
Very happily married.
Ayuh.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
Duke...
Yeah!
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
I'm too busy, actually. Not for the Army, of course, but where I live. Dr. Yamachi's New Era Pediatric Hospital and Whorehouse. I'm serious. The guy has this crude hospital for kids and a whorehouse on the side to finance it, all in the same building.
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
Don Juanism is just a cover... I've been reading up on it.  I'm a fake, I'm a fraud, I've been living a lie!
No, never in the slightest.
Big day. Two jaws to rebuild.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
I – wouldn't – wish – it – on – a – maneating – shark.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Your tent?
We don't want any more than that.  Right now.
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
Yes, that's what I mean.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
They can't do that to me!
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Against what?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Thirty dollars.
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
A hundred dollars!
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Wait a minute . . .
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
What letter?
The letter from John Doe.
John Doe.
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Oh.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
I used to pitch.
Both of 'em?
Sure. Mostly often.
All right. You're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. They're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. Is that right?
Tell him about making Sourpuss chairman, honey.
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
Five thousand bucks!  I had it right in my hand!
Huh? Get what?
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
No, I didn't.
No.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
What difference does that make?
Thanks.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets the flowers.
Yeah.
Okay.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You want me to go up with you?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
You don't want to know.
Nobody knows who you are. Make it look like a robbery.
How can I help you with the particles?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
You got it.
Being faxed over now.
Roper...
Roper, we're into it...
For now that's all.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Recruited you from where?
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
I think so.
I'm not good at lying.
Why?
So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
Fine.
Now she's going out with Greg Barnett?
And doing a very good job of it.
You're crazy.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
Is the hostage injured?
Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
Ronnie...
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Who's running it!
Kimura and Glass will head the investigation.
Any verification on numbers.
Just that I'd talk to my superiors.
What do you want?
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
It's all been transferred.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
No...
In here I am.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
At least a day.
-- He won't.
The truth.
Yes, in theory, I suppose that would work.
Cleaning up a mess.
Who are you?!
But I don't know anything about programming.
Realize?
You don't need a lawyer.  We found the program on your laptop.
My uni-net account.  I log on.  The program's there.
Just like that?
Uplink selected.
Billy, that's BRILLIANT!
It will not harm you.
OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE!!
How about Major Moron?
Did I say anything?
So they've been destroyed?
But ya got a Boss.
Torrio ain't like them guys. He thinks like an American. You'd like him, Charlie. He'd like you.
But not you.
Not another word.
No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
And now you have everything.
Scared.
If we have to.
Sure, Frankie. Fuck me. Fuck Meyer. Fuck Arnold Rothstein who's made us all rich. All so you can be an fuckin' honorary Sicilian!
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I'm already late.
You got something to hide?
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
It always is.
A million bucks. In the last six months.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
We can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
Come on. Tell us, Shitface.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He's trying to make it.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
Shit. When I was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. Guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. Right, Gerardo?
I'll take care of the Boss.
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
Back? You're sending me back?
But these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
Less.
Do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? You gotta <u>strike</u>. I'm talking mansions. Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
I got the ring. <i></i> Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
What's the "bad" part?
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can <u>warn</u> her what Monkeybone is up to??
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Stu... It's a <u>party</u>.
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. It was different then. I was <u>depressed</u>. My life is great now. I'm in love!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
I just need to use the phone, lady.
You want to come inside?
That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters.
I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village.  I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
You know ...  ... whoops!
He seemed quite taken with you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Mm hmm.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Yeah.
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
Calendar for the day. You'll find the Senate Manual in the drawer. Anything else you want, just snap for a page.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I did not--
It couldn't be.
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up--  --*five more minutes*!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
What! Who?
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
And to Don Quixote!
Yeah.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Yeah.
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
Right now--everything I own--!
That infernal phone!
Sam Foley--dead!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Oh! Go away.
*But you never asked me*!
Oh--Jim!
Will you please tell me *exactly* what he's done?
I doubt it! Come on, Ken.
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator-- Washington.
Well, that ends that crisis. This way, Senator.
To--to a reception--uh--for a princess-- I forget her name--
For a question!
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some plaster for a cast on Amos' leg-- he's always chewing 'em off. I'll only be a minute--if you'll excuse me, sir--
Mine? Why--naturally--whatever benefits the state is mighty important to me--owning a lot of its industry-- newspapers and other odds and ends. And if I thought you had the welfare of the state at heart, like myself-- for instance, if you were to turn around and help a project like this along instead of standing in the way-- why, I'd say you were a man to watch. For a fellow your age, you'd be in a spot to make a great start in life. If you liked business--you could pick any job in the state and go right to the top. Or politics. If you like being a Senator. No reason why you couldn't come back to that Senate for the rest of your life.
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Yes. They give it to a *sub*- committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. *But* it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
But you've had beautiful country all around you. You've just had to life up your eyes!
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Lena.
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Yes. The most beautiful I think I ever--gee--  Say--we're *never* going to finish this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. I'm going to talk faster'n you can write--
In Terry Canyon?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Wow!
Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man they ought to be listening to! Come on!
A camp! Well!
Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?
I'm splendid, too.
It's just as well to tell you--because if we're going to get off on the right foot--I mean--in case I act sort of strange--it's the suit.
No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! I'm not making sense!
Swell!
What! Who?
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Susan!
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it right with you!
Well--that's very fine.  Saunders, some person in your office says you've quit--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Why don't you do it yourself?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
Joe--do you mean to say--do you think you can actually *handle* this--this whatever-you-call-it in Washington?
A young patriot?--Who recites Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose in our nation's capital? I think I can.
Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose on this right away. Greatest appointment ever made. A banquet-- declare a holiday.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--
Keep doing it! This is the whole works, Joe--we're out of business of bigger than we then we ever were. We can't miss a trick--we can't stop at *anything*--till this yokel's smashed up and buried so deep he'll never--!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Who are you?
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Sometimes he whistles.
Yes!
That's all, Miss Bennett.
What's that got to do with it?
Yeah, let's.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
What did you mean by that?
Sure!
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
With pay!
Is he really that big a sap?
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
That's the rub.
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Yes, sir.
Let me go! I wanna see him!
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
What was that you said he was?
Mr. Cedar!
Wants to know who the heir is.
See you later, kid.
What for?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
No, thanks.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Are those stories true?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Oh Yes, of course - you've just been elected.
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
Let me alone!  If you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  How did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  Get a kick out of it, huh? Got a big laugh?  Did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! No!
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
Binge?
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - but on the top.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I just wanted to make sure.
What's that?
Looking for?
Yeah.
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
No!  What do you want!!
Really? You think so?
I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
Not any more.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
I didn't hear you.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
And the experiment is in here?
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
I'm not at liberty to say. Sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. We'll be in touch.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
What?
I'd better get in there.
That's a lot of people all at once.
What are they?
Who was that?
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
Got to.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble.  My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
You like it?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Um-huh.
I don't follow you.
I think so.
Sofie...
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's called pro bono.
Where was this?
What do you want me to see?
If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
He agreed?
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
This --
-- Skip. Knowing what you do about me --
Really?
It's not?
Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Hey, you've done good. Look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
Psych major?
I'm honored.
What?
When?
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Relax, I got him.
Are we talkin, about the same creature? The walking corpse? Really big mouth? Really bad breath?
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the ritual.
Excuse me?
Altar boys?
I've had worse.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
-- And read the sacred incantations contained inside it.
Two hundred pounds.
Proceed!
No.
-- I know what you mean. I was there, alright. Seti's place. The City Of The Dead.
What did you find? What did you see?
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to the underworld", actually.
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
What are those mirrors for?
That bad huh?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
I'm staying.
I think you were jealous
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep them.
That just makes you more gullible.
Well neither do I, thank you.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Don't worry, Pootchkie. My womanizing days are over. You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my Nicole.  We're such an incredible team. Who could possibly stop us? 
Fantasizing... about you.
Do it, big boy!
I can't.
Let's do it.
Yes!
Thanks.
He's dead.
Think positive.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Really?
I saw him walk you home.
I guess... Are you always so angry?
Not tonight. 
Alone tonight?
Sure.
It is?
What's your real name?
Roy.
I just want to be a superhero.
And a skunk stinks!
Now you're talking.
Yeah.
There's a vague similarity.
A vague similarity? IT'S THE SAME GUY!
Why not?
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
Hey... he's gone.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
Mother... it's not what you think!
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Who are they?
Yeah, but how do we get to them?
The bazookas?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
I am in no position to debate this with you, Your Majesty, but can you imagine what a blow it will be to the Emperor if you should now desert his cause?  It would mean nothing less than victory for England.
I believe I am right in saying that, before the fire, the country had grown weary of the war, and there were few who were interested in continuing the battle.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
I will accept your assurance, but I'm afraid I don't see your point.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Ah -- you approve?
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
What do you mean?
May I come to the map?
Thank you for coming.  Would you care for a drink?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
Cavalry?
You realize what is at stake?
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
It is a terrible shock.
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Come back in an hour.
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
The first reports came in at about ten.
It is the work of incendiaries.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Good morning, sir.  Are you General Bonaparte?
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Of course.
Open the door.  It's me.
I know what you're doing in there.
In case of a... surprise attack... at night... I am such a... light sleeper... I could wake you... I could scream.
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
That's all I can say.
Let's just say, he looks after your interests.
Do you know what you're saying?
You are much younger, and much more handsome, than your pictures.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Major Lavallette to see you, General.
And I can go free?
Well, let me in.
I don't know!
Don't move me.
Cheeco.
Whatever you say, man.  I didn't see shit.  The safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.
I know; this a long way from Watts.  But what I like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  Just peace and quiet.  Listen.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Damn, you got a stalker.
You got a restraining order on a little girl named Baby D?
Why?
No.
Wait for what?
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
I don't know.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Make sure.
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  I'm currently running the store. Can I see the CD?
You damn right that's the big one.
Bummer, huh?  And Friday is suppose to be a kick-ass day.
He's inside the house?
Man, we can't ride to Rancho Cucamonga on that.
That ain't gonna work.
I don't know.
Huh?
Good, let's get out.
I'll take you later.
'Take your car?'
What's the matter?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Come on, El, you're a trooper. I'll get you some Pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to Sacramento. This is no time to lay down on the job. I don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. Look what happened to Bush. Tell you what, if you want to blow off the Sacramento speech, fine. But do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
The grave. Somebody close?
Oh, yeah?
I appreciate that.
That's right.
You were very nervous.
Same to you.
What's your point?
Yes, you will, Mr. Watson.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Then I have time for a drink.
You fucked up.
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
I kill her - and you kill me.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
Let me talk to her again.
I want'to talk to her.
Forget about it.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
We made it.
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
No, kisses to...
I said I have to do something.
Please. Something is going to happen...
Cover your mouth.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
Oh, Jesus ...
What!?
Don't be like that. Think of me as the Moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
Fuck you!
What?
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
A surprise?
Yeah.
Where?
What do you figure he done with it?
Hm!
That's right, Preacher. I robbed that bank because I got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of Depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and I promised myself I'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
Salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
And the times that are gone by. I'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. How's your Maw?
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Yes! Yes!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
How do you mean?
I'm figurin' how I can say it so's you won't get mad.
About what!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
John don't like him much.
I would love to be satisfied Harry Powell don't think I've got that money somewhere.
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
Go ahead of me -- the both of you.
Under the stone in the floor.
You could save him, little bird.
I knowed your Daddy.  And do you know what your Daddy said to me? He said, "Tell my little girl Pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
All right.
Can I have milk too?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
I reckon it's been ordained this way, Brother Spoon.
She'll not be back. I reckon I'd be safe in promisin' you that.
Get up.
I'm through, Harry.
She took them kids with her?
The man! The man!
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Jesus.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Haven't slept, have you?
Well what you reading it for?
The killer.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Just want to talk to him a second.
You don't know he did it.
Just tell me who did it and I'll go get him, baby.
Uh, she just saw you, sir...
'Anything funny' like what?
Krueger.
I won't.
I want to know how, where -- if you don't tell me, I'm going to call daddy.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Because somebody cut her. While I watched.
No.
Jungle man fix Jane.
Guys can have nightmares too, y'know. You ain't got a corner on the fucking market or something.
Aren't you late?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
Possibly.
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
Or it might be the firing squad!
I can tell you exactly.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
And they might believe her in Moscow.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Shall we tell her?
Oh, yes, yes.
That's all right.
I am, Gaston.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
Yes, General Savitzky?
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
What did she say about me?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Yes, Comrade.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
That's two weeks from Thursday...
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Business.
You believe in our cause?
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
What?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
In other words you don't know.
No.
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
That is correct.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Wounded? How?
I have never heard one.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up...  A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
What does he say?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
Yes.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Madame, if you...
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I think this is the first time you have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it be?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
Where is it?
My jewels?!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Then his office will be fine.
Frankly, sir, it stinks.  I have no access.  I'm lucky Helms lets me have a staff.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
What?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
You do it.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Well, he's photogenic.  Let's try dog bones?
Sure.  Lyndon, JFK, FDR -- I mean, Truman cut the shit out of my investigation of Hiss back in '48.
And?
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
That's what they're doing.
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
Can we get around this, Al?
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
Yes, you approved it, sir.
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
"Security" is not strong enough.
How about a COMINT classification?  We put it on the Huston plan.  Even the designation is classified.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
That's right, and it's more a problem for Ehrlichman.  He fixed Hunt up with the phony CIA ID's, but ... what else does Hunt have on us?
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
I tell you, the soldiers were provoked.  Now stop this pussyfooting around.  Dead kids!  How the hell did we ever give the Democrats a weapon like this?  I mean, if Cambodia doesn't work, we'll bomb Hanoi if we have to.
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Let him finish, Bob.
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
Townsend gave us 300 grand.  Belgium's not worth more than 100, 150 ...
No ...
Is it my turn?
What ... ?
You're correct.  I'm concerned these students are being funded by foreign interests, whether they know it or not.  The FBI is worthless in this area.  I want your full concentration on this matter ...
Yes.
Not if you have spies in the White House, it isn't your job.
Mr. Helms, we've lived with Communism in Cuba for ten years ...
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
You're fucking me.
Personally I'd prefer a greyhound with a shot of speed.
Well, uh, Trini and I have an early plane.  We were hoping to get back to New York in time for ...
She's quite pretty.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
I had nothing to do with that, sir, and I resent any implication ...
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
Do you ever pray?  You know ... believe in a Supreme Being?
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Yes.
Looks can be deceiving ...
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
Free, if you're the president.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
You mean smashed!  She called up at midnight last week.  Talking a bunch of crap.  Pat can't stand her.
Talks all day, too!  How the hell can you put up with her, John?
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
Don't worry -- I'll use the old Nixon charm on her.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
Mr. Nixon.
Who the fuck are they?  Bob, are you working on revoking the Posts's television license?  Good.
Yes, yes.
No, sir ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
You know how much money he had in the bank when he died?  Nothing.  He was so damned honest ...  But I miss him.  I miss him a hell of a lot.
Yeah ... I'm out.
He doesn't want me at the funeral.
I need you out there.  It won't be like last time.  The war's crippled the Democrats.  I can win ... We deserve it.  Yeah, it's ours, Buddy -- at last.  Nobody knows better than you.  Frank Nixon's boy.
Because ... I have to relax.
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Yes, it's been a long time ...
I'm not scared, Buddy.  You don't understand.  They're playing for keeps, Buddy.  The press, the kids, the liberals -- they're out there, trying to figure out how to tear me down.
When?
Tomorrow.
Hiya, fellow ... What were they?
Some say you are, Rocky.
Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over.
I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that.
Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well...
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Try "old" on for size.
Well what would you call him.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
It's not me he's in trouble with.
Some pretty bad people.
That's possible.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
I don't know. Oh.
I don't know. He ought to...
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Okay.
Hyah!
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
To your husband.
Llewelyn!
Big talk.
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Yes ma'am?
She'll be all right.
She'll be all right?
I can't say.
Sir I ain't at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
You expect him?
So what're you goin' up there for.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
I see.
Well...
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
Yes I do.
I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is.
Yes.
Everything.
Somethin' like that.
What kind of tent?
Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Yessir. I understand that.
That's not an answer.
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
Another additional.
What else then?
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
No sir.
I got an overcoat on.
Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column?  I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Did you send anyone out there?
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
Any idea where it is?
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
...I... I know what you are.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
Umm, I don't think that...
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
...I don't think I know that hospital.
Alright. Oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... Well done.
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
All the time...
What are you talking about?
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
George...
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I don't know.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
...did I win some contest?
You're hurting him!!
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
Who?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
Georgia. In case I didn't tell you, it's cash only, gentlemen.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
He goin' crazy on us, or what?
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Like what?
I... I don't know...
My socks?
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
You told me how to do it!
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
I hope you're right...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I know that.
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
I'm not telling.
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
I never said that I believed...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
Betty was a lovely child.
I see.  May I?
What the hell's going on?
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
David Ravell.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Well I was lyin' - and I'm proud to say that that sin's been warshed away too!  Neither God nor man's got nothin' on me now! Come on in, boys, the water's fine!
Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism. You may call it obtuse. But the plain fact is we still have... close to... close to...
Not that I'm aware.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Well, it's a well-run campaign, midget'n broom'n whatnot.
Devil his due.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Not out the other side his face, though.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
You didn't know that at the time!
That ain't the tune you were singin' back there at the gallows!
It was a powerful air.
Well people like that reform. Maybe we should get us some.
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
Yes, sir.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Ever heard of knocking, mayo?
No, sir!
No, sir!
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
Yes, sir!
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
Yes, sir!
What did you call me, boy?
Before that.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Sid, there's no baby.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
You hope.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Really?
I know who you are and what you want.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
God.
Does it still hurt?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
No. Is that what you want?
Your real father?
Why?
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. Drives his German car up to 125th Street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  You don't know one thing about me!
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
This is ridiculous...
Get the fuck away from me.
Not that one.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
I know.
Raoul is cool.  That's all you need to know.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
Do me a favor and don't talk.
What do you want?
Huh?
The sentence that started "There are three."  What was the rest?
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
Will they take asking price?  I need a two week escrow and I'm already approved for the loan.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
This is it?  I told you on the phone, I have to be moved in in two weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce that here.
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Open the door.
What?!
Different phone line, I never hooked it up!
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Shaky?
Give me a break.
Dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
No.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
What if I keep dropping?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Okay.
What are doing with yours?.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
Damn straight...  Let's go check out these Paper Panthers.
I hear you. Alright. I'll go, you stay.
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Yeah.
I ain't gonna shoot you Judge. Look... it's over. Just run away. Get out. Stay away from Oakland. Cause it's gone... it's gone.
Who's they?
Yeah, it was alright. Hey, can you give me a lift?
You got it. Berkeley?
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Neither your stomach or your opinion matters here Dorsett... What matters is that Mr. Trafficante and the Bureau have come up with a solution to our Panther Problem. One might say...The Final Solution.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
Freedom... We're just gonna test some of the words in that law book.
I don't know.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
S'alright. I'm sorry too. Shit, I gotta take a leak... Pull over at that gas station.
Later for that. I'm done either way...
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
It's a start.
Goodbye.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare, officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
The middle colonies?
He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee, he'll dissolve the body.
Yes.
Not yet.  What happened?
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
You know how old I am.
God help us all when you're forty.
I didn't see any.
We're low on salt.  I should go to Pembroke and get some.
No...
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
I know.
I'm not my mother.  I can't have the respect without the knowing.
Nonetheless, I would like to know, Mister Marion, how... how... how...
Gabriel.
There's nothing you could have done, Gates is a damned fool.
When?
Long time.
Yes... you will wait.
For what?
Put them away.
Quiet.
It's a place where the dead speak, Missy.
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
For a little while.
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
That's enough, Ellen.
You believe in it.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I swear.
Well, but Missus Creed! It ain't quite that way, deah!
What were you listening to?
Me neither. But I believe in knowing your enemy.
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
Yes.  Where are we going, Jud?
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
What did we do, Jud?
Why, then, things should be fine.
What?
You're thinking of things best not thought of, Louis.
And because the dead walked.
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed. Don't go on, doc. No matter how much you feel you have to. There's more power here than you know.
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
I got eggs down here!
Louis, are you sure?
That boat is my livelihood!
You'll get it back.  Or one better.
Aye, aye, sir!
Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -- you and Cotton.  I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and- span and ship-shape!
We got that part.  Anything else?
Eh?  You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul.
Quite, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.  Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship.  I agreed to set them free.  I didn't when ... nor where.
Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
The situation has changed.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Can I trust you?
It's a pirate medallion.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Commodore, you can't do that!
Ceremony?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
About the day we met. Do you remember?
Parlay!  I invoke the right of parlay!  According to the Code of the Brethern, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain!
Truthfully -- you were a bit late.
Now I must hear this song.  An authentic pirate song.  Have at it.
More to drink!
You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main.
He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
I don't think that will be necessary.
Indeed.
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Barbossa.
Depends.
On what?
On whether the stories are all true.  If they are, that's a waterfall that spills over at high tide, with a short drop to an underground lagoon.  If not --
He's not telling the truth.
An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Susan, I sense you are having difficulty understanding the situation you are presently in.  I ask that you keep in mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I want.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh yes, Icky.  I can feel it.
Poppy, this is not the time!
The nanobot is gone.
A man?
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
You're looking for a urine sample.
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
I've only been invited to her house once, but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private research.
Okay.
Right.  You predicted it.
The nanobot.
What happened to it?
No, no, I just feel wired!
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
Just giving credit where credit is due.
You have no one to blame but yourself.
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
The nanobot... it's not here...
Like a glove.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
What could happen?  I'm the plastic man, remember?
We've got to get the nanobot.
Oh yes you are!
Forget it, pissboy!  You tell Argon he can call my lawyer.
Yeah, I have something I've been meaning to give you.
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
You may go, Smythe.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you?  Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Gallagher!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves—
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband—He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him.  —and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them!  Come on, Gallagher.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Sit down!
You're the Tribune man?
We were classmates.
Yeah. The boss sent me over to offer you a job. He wants you to write a daily column on the Tribune.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Not on my own beat, no.
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Oh no, sir!
Now Mr. Smith, now please—
Outside!
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
I bet.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
Never even been to New Madrid.
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
Traps shut!
Now don't be absurd, Smith—  May I come in?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Are the cars ready?
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
Get out of here.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
No, sir!
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Yes sir.
Yes.
In my handbag.
Looks just like it did.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I had to say goodbye.
I love you too.
I was in a bowling-alley.
No I'm not sweetie.
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
We were gonna ... You know ...
What's the matter?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
Yes I did.
Very well ...
The basketball team?
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
You're not allowed to lie.
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Um ... Outside of Pleasantville.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
Neither do I.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color!  Oh God ...
Owns the hardware store.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
As a matter of fact he does.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
You weren't playing a joke? She woulda gone out with me?
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
What's that like?
McIntire's.
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Well c'mere, young fella.
Oh ... I do. Yeah. It's just that I told my "dad" I'd clean out the rain gutters and Mr. Johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
Excuse me?
I'm going to leave now.
Oh. You're a smart little bastard aren't you?  It's kind of like a restricted ticket. You gotta leave the same way you came.
Well you weren't around this time so I did the whole thing myself.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
What happened?
A miracle.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Why?
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I feel really on the spot now.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
Call me later.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm doing?
Where are you?
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
Do you like porno movies?
I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.
Yeah. And looking at myself in the mirror. Do you wanna know what I look like?
...yes...
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
I'm fine. Who is this?
Yes.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I didn't lie.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
I don't know.
Yes I do.
It's terrible, no.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Sure.
Yeah.
....yeah....
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Ok.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Ok. Have a good trip.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
This is nice.
Yeah.
Did you have my home phone number?
No.
I don't know.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I didn't do it.
Please don't do this to me.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
What do you mean?
-- and this is confidential?
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
I'll say whatever I want --
Mhm.
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
Ok. You're connected.
It takes time to process --
Yes I'm fine.
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Let's just figure that out later --  Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
You have another house somewhere or something?
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
This is a bunch of bullshit.
Seriously.
I know.
I'll see you there.
What's the problem?
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
My years tending the lepers at St. Emilion steeled me for life's grisliest offerings, Doctor.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Don't be so sure.
You among them?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Your words drove Bouchon to --
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
I know, because I felt it myself --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
His wife's influence.
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
And place my reputation at stake?
And --?
He's sworn to obedience.
I have.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Poorly.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Is it terribly erotic?
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Go on, child.
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
You've come to lecture me?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Very much.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Houdini mice.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
He needs me here.
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Bel Air is restricted.
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
There is nothing to discuss-
I wanted it
There's a different between want and
castle -- still fighting old battles he will never win with Pulitzer and Roosevelt and Hollywood--
Yes?
The drinking.
Please be quiet.
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
Nix, sweetie. You shelve it
Telling stories.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Please don't say this.
Mank-
Orson. Stop. Just stop
Listen to you. You child! Men like him don't bother with things like legality. They don't have to. You know why, boy-o?   Power.   Power like you couldn't even begin to imagine.
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
The title?
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
So they're Jews. . .
Believe you me, they're gonna do anything -- and I mean absolutely anything -- to stop that word from gettin' out.
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Mank!
Herman.
That's for me to decide.
You're going to destroy it
Again.
"Your movie" -- I am so sick of that! It's your movie -- but it's his life! Did you ever think about that?! Did you ever think about that old man and Marion having to watch as you tore them apart?!
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Orson -- we can't get the fucking camera any fucking lower so find another fucking shot!
Yeah.
He's Christ?
For what?
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
How do you know? You know her that good?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Ah, no, no. I didn't bang her. I know her from around here, that's all. You want to meet her or what?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.
What did Tommy say?
Yeah, I know.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What do you mean, "you"?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Does that mean...
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
Just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. Just a chip of ice.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
No, I'm not.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' Romeo around here. Did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
Huh?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
I never noticed his face.
What'd you see?
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Are you kiddin'? Did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? Did you see the papers? "LaMotta on Vice Rap." Everybody likes a shot at the Champ.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
All right, I'll try. See you later.
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
That's what they call a family problem.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
I'll bet it's been done.
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
All the things I hate.
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
She's all right.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
How did you know!
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
Get back there! He'll see you!
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend.  An old, ornery friend.
Would four of them -- ?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Mrs. Doyle?
Not a word.
Goodnight, you idiot.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
Without any future?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
Yeah.
To get on home.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Thank you.
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Too close.
How?
L. B. Jefferies.
Wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
Friend of yours?
What's eating you, Judy?  You want him alive?
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Is there some kind of trick answer?
How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
We don't have time.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Are you listening to me?  You're involved in this!  I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Say, listen--
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  The kid has no friends yet and--
Are you going down there?
I still think you should go down.
Open it.
Come with me, John.
Well maybe she better start.
Plato.
Head-shrinker?
Look--can't you see I'm writing?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Jim.  What's yours?
I know.  That's why I came back.
Help me in!
What?
There's only one key.
Come on!
Hey!  How 'bout that!
Not lately.
I had to go to a head-shrinker.  I only went twice though.  My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I've got a gun.
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Just a guard.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
It doesn't matter how.  I was driving a stolen car--
What's that got to do with it?
Grandma?
No.
No.
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
But you don't think that's a solution.
A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Okay--
You serious?
Yes, ma'am.
I'm getting that way, too.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
See, we're very modern.
I bet you hear everything I say!
You smell like baby powder.
I did?  Well, he might as well be dead.  What's the difference?
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Yes it was all you --
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
Nick...
What's going ON!!!
JESUS CHRIST!
No, Nick, no --
Canada.
No!
There went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... Ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. I gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
You saved me.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
I'm glad it was me.
What are you talking about?
But I never said Rudy.
You what...
I got out, Nick didn't! I pretended I was him! I knew about her letters! Jesus Christ, whatever you want from him -- I'm not Nick!  I -- I just wanted to be --
She says a lot of things.
What's her middle name?
What college.
A station wagon in Canada.
I did.
What the fuck are you talking about.
'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
Leave the tree.
What... Powwow...
He's not Nick Mason...
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
It's a roach, guy --
I'm just saying.
I'm just talking.
Yeah. You grow up in Detroit, you get matured real quick.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
What, working security?
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Oh, fuck, Rudy... oh Jesus...
Do what?
They changed the layout.
That I should've picked you up?
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
You ain't dying, he is.
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Was he all pissed off?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
...What bar?
Did the two of you talk?
The Milwaukee Brewers?
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Can you move the ice afterwards? I don't know nobody who can move ice.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Don't ask me that.
Your name's Freddy something.
What're you talkin' about?
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
I wasn't born yesterday. I'm hurt, and I'm hurt bad.
I can' take you to a hospital.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. But those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.  You haven't thought about this?
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
Splash some water on your face. Take a breather.
What's wrong with it?
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh-uh, just cops.
At that point it became every man for himself. As far as Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest. Once I got out, I never looked back.
Not even a chance they punched through? You found a hole.
Where? Are they out in the car?
That was the plan, we meet here.
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
We can't take him to a hospital.
There's a slight difference.
Yeah, those guys too.
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
It doesn't matter who they are.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Why do you think?
You don't mean that Clay.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
To the other side of the street.
You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
I don't want to run short.
Yes.
Lednov.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder.  Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
You'll live.
I can't take her with me.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
If she says anything to them I'll kill her.
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Then why stay in the hills.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
Maybe in Sonora.
There's still tomorrow morning.
Everybody knows --
Who brought you here?
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
What do they look like?
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Let me do that.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Thanks, Steve.
Ah, they just don't know you the way I do.
That's it.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Psychology.
No, you don't understand. It's here in these statues...
It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Yes, of course, Uriah. I feel his evil presence.
He's not dead, you idiot. He lives in Florida. Now, shut up and let me finish.
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.
Yeah, I think I'll feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
Yeah.
Wait, I want to check something. Give me a hand.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Great!!!
Can you feel that?
No. Keep rubbing.
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
Hot dogs.
I think so.
Oh, right.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
My child, you're alive!
Now you gotta learn the correct slang.
Are you?
Theo, did you see the animal?
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
That's what turns me on about you, Dwight. You're so smart.
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
That's it. I'm gonna put my food in your ass. I should warn you, I'm a black belt in karate.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Dog, you look hot.
"Fucked me."
The "Citizen Kane" of gore movies.
Bye, bird-brain. See ya, Scotty.
Mother? 
She wouldn't...
You said you hated him.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
She sure can pick 'em!
You scared me.
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Nice?! He should have been executed!
Oooohhhh.
Oh, honey!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Yes, I am... I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson... It's driving me crazy... I've changed my number twice already... Please help me!
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
GODDAMN YOU!
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
I do, please.
We all have bad nights. 
Misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
No, honey, it's the police.  Hello, officers.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
NO! I could never hurt anyone!
Yes, but I lent it...
He's a good boy.
His unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
Divorce? An alcoholic relative?  Tell me, did Chip torture animals when he was young?
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
You won't get any water and you won't get any rest. You may as well drink.
Yes.
What circumstances?
Hello, Frances.
I'll try there.
But I like teaching school.
I guess most people are.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
A job?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
I won't get lonely.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It's quite natural that he should read books on the history of old religious societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor --?
It's grown big with time -- I've lived here with the Romari's for ten years -- the room's become part of me. I want you to see it —— to know me better.
I have to go —-
I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.
But you should make her laugh, Jason. Come, make jokes for her. I'll bring your food to their table.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
I saw you with her last week. I knew you'd be here tonight. Where is she?
But why come to me?
I've lost my knack.
Uh—huh.
Cloven hoof?
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
I didn't know.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Because I have something very important to do.
Oh.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
I think so. I remember reading somewhere that men learn to love what they're attracted to, whereas women become more and more attracted to the person they love.
Do you want me to?
Videotapes.
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Yes.
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
But I don't understand --
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
But that was part of it?
Like maybe a big part?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Well, are you?
You've made your point.
I want out of this marriage.
I want out of this marriage.
Why?
Yes.
Not very often.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Well, last week we talked about your obsession with the families of airline fatalities, and now we're talking about your concern over the garbage problem.
If you think about it, I think you'll see that the object of your obsession is invariably something negative that you couldn't possibly have any control over.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him.  After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
It's possible that Graham has hidden motives for disliking therapy and/or therapists. Perhaps he has problems of his own that he is unwilling to deal with, and he would like to see other people, you for instance, wallow in their situation just as he does. Do you think that's possible?
Yes.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
What's wrong with that?
What kinds of questions?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You are in trouble.
I can't believe you did that!!
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
Well. I can't stay.
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
Nope.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
When I was fourteen.
Were you disappointed?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
He said that my hand felt good.
Okay.
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
You are scum. I'll be there.
I want to see you.
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Shit, after what you've told me, I don't know. I should've known, when he showed up dressed like some arty brat.
I like the way he dresses.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Why not?
You realize you have no recourse legally? This stuff could show up anywhere.
It won't. I trust him.
Did he put you up to this?
God, you... you're mean.
Student?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
One moment.
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yes?
Yeah.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Yeah. This is an island, you know? Takes too long to get into the city. We gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
No. I don't think so.
I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Well, at least you still talk the same.
So who changes?
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
Yeah? What do I do then?
BREAKING OUT
He needs help.
I've caught it once or twice.
Home?
SPONSOR!!!
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
It's happened before.  Remember Lieutenant Orpheus?  He disappeared into that Underworld series and never came back.
Shove it, Ralph!
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
YOUNG BLOOD
Me?
He will.  But it's up to you to reawaken his feelings.  You've got to be fabulous, look, think and appear fabulous.  And Farley's given you that chance.  You can use the Breakfast Show to knock Denton dead.
What does he know about it?
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
...and an attractive financial prospect for Denton.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
You got it.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you need some money?
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
That's on us.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Beautiful.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Okay! Fuck!
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here.  Drink some agua.
What the fuck are you doing?
Deep.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
Yeah.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
With Maya.
You have to tell me --
Are they too sporty?
I don't know. Tastes okay to me.  Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
What's that?
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Twelve months in oak.
I know. I love that.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
What's the title?
"The Day After Yesterday."
Yeah. Thanks.
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Yeah.
Got it.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Does she ever answer back?
This one?
Dad!
I see.
I heard.
How can you say that?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
Philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
Who wrote this book?
Sorry.
No.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Pinned? What does that mean?
Yeah.
They think it might happen all at once.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
Wait a minute! If you don't believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in Turley before we did the job.
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
And you're not Baxter, either?
No, Leavenworth.
Anybody got any ideas?
I'll be around.
I'm going to California with my brother.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
Who?
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
Tomorrow we're going to town to straighten that out once and for all. The next day we'll be back here... farming. And these cattle better be gone.
Never will again.
And a pretty lady.
They're drawn to me by that. But it never lasts.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
We didn't get that far.
Oh, a guy who got run out of town...
I don't want you getting anyone in my place.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
So this is the guy you're going to hang?
Rae, all we got is each other.
Shut up. You need help, don't you?
Because they enjoy it.
I heard that too.
Where's the dog?
You've got a legitimate job.
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
You like a good saloon?
Here he comes right now.
Give me some of the good stuff.
He can't hurt me if he's dead.
I thought you two would get along.
Of course.
Who?
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Why not?
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Which accounts for your percentage.  When do I get to meet this dream?
Not today.  She's learning her lines.  You can also take cue cards and teleprompter out of the budget.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
Excuse me?  Start?
I want you back too, Viktor.
Not if I don't let her.
You?
No... it's life.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Is that a problem?
I'm not even sure I deserve it. After tonight I'll have almost as much screen time on your show as I do in my movies.  How is that healthy for a performer?
Really?  She didn't mention it.
How did the wall get there?
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
I have your new leading lady...  ... right here in my pants.
That's right.  You were booed off the stage.  That's got to be -- ?
-- Eight years ago.  In that whole time, I never left my computer.
Good for you, Hank.
I won't be here next week.  The tumor's inoperable.  I'll be dead.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
How?
I do okay.  How about you?
I love you too, daddy.
It's from both of us.  Of course you'll have to drive it around the lot until you get your permit --
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
Don't you?
My God, you've got one?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
--Do I know you?
You're a doctor. What kind?
Not even little ones that aren't supposed to hurt?
No.
See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do have a question.
You mean aneurysm.
Words.
You weren't a paper champion.
Yes.
Standing next to my window.
I know.
Cole, please stop.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Stuttering--
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Someone actually... employs you?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Bus broke down.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Pardon?
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
That's your grandfather you're talking about!  I... know what people say. Heard it... all my life.
Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Down boy.
Bzzzzzzzzzt!
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Nah. Just you.
Let it go.
You never had trouble communicating before.
I was getting 'warmed' up.
You're right, Jack. Margaret, you're fired.
Oh, yeah?
That wasn't a good night, no.
Okay.
And this is mine.
I see. It's like as if he's going in a pattern. Is that what you're saying, Bill?
We're coming your way, man!
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
Shelby --
Yeah.
I got to leave my post.
Sure you do.
I got a super--special birthday present for you this year. I couldn't risk you finding it, so I had to put them locks on the doors.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
How much style?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Having fun.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
A Texas Bear in Arkansas.  Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
Hey...
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
Yeah.
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
No what?
Another time.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
Also boring.
Running blocker.
Bandit?
Why are we doing this?
Redneck heaven.
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I hate to say it...
Anything else you don't want me to know?
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
You okay?
You're coming up to the scale house.
What's that, pardner?
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
How's your twenty?
Oh.
-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
And who has access to that floor?
And a very bad gamble.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
All of 'em. His entire entourage. I think we should move.
Yeah.
Wait a minute, what other agent?  What other agent?
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Yeah.
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
...About what?
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
I been accused of worse.  What do we got...?
I got his machine.
I am. Yeah.
That's right! RIGHT NOW!
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
-- no, we need to handle it now.
...He does now...
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
No... We're trying to save Heller.
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
How are we on time...?
Got hit twice.
True?
Like a mafucka.
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
What?
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
Right mafuck'n now girl. Fast as we can get you there. We wait any longer, someone goin' dead this fool.
Didn't you talk to Snow?
Kelvin, she begged me.  I had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  She walked into it and disappeared.  She was gone.
You fucking bastard...
Shut up.
My wife.
That's ludicrous.  This is contact. We have found God.  The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth.  So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
But they are human.  They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough.  They build up with experience.
She drank liquid oxygen.
You do, you don't.  She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it.  Don't you see?  No, you don't.
I won't be making the trip.
I'll just be a minute.
Why?
I want you inside me right now.
Better.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
Yes.  Yes.
Was she right?
He is.  But he was here...
Rheya --
Who are you, then?
But then I would be dead now.
I wish you wouldn't.
You must have been dreaming.
Occasionally.
Uh...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I'm supposed to call in.
Hmm...
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Urdu and Hindi.
You were reading my Renoir.
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
Tell it like it is.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
They called here after you left...
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
"To"... Forget about you.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I do.
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
The gun?  It's in the upstairs closet.
What are you talking about?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
She took you shopping for a tie?
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
You talked to his wife?
El?  I'm sorry.  I do love you.  And you are a lady.  I have so much respect...
I heard.
It should've been me...
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
Erect.  You know, a "boner?"  I'd heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I'll prove it!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Lay back, Mack!!  What's this "lay back, Mack?"  Where does he get this?
No, I'm not coming in.  And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
Shooting?
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Be nice.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
I'm parked illegally!
They'll never take me alive.
Let me guess.  The hunting dogs. You lost your scholarship.
I am not pitiful!  I am the bridge to the Übermensch!
You're not half the idiot I am, Harry.
Yeah--
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
Mr. Jameson--
Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength...
What if you get hurt?
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
I've gotta study.
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
Oh, Peter. A zit.
I'm a photographer, remember?
Funny thing happened after my physics class today. Harry Osborn--
Aunt May, what happened?
Hi.  I've got sort of a hypothetical question.  Do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
I mean, I suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
Perhaps. But every now and then someone pays attention.  You did.
Truth.  Truth alone exists. Truth must be released...
I'll try. Thanks.
Like it?
I just gave-- yeah, sure.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Bonkers.
Jawohl.
Is you all little Adolfs?
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Any news on Dunbar?
I don't know anymore.
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
Ask Security.  You tell him, Price. You've got me shadowed every minute of the day. Or haven't you found out yet?
You make my mouth water.
I'll call the whole pot.
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I didn't do it -- I didn't do it.
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
I said say it again. I didn't say repeat it.
I clocked him this morning. He was running like a doll.
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
Take some men and get the antenna going. Let's see if we can catch the BBC.
Answer the question. How do you rate all those privileges?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Yes, I'm from Cleveland.
Are you questioning me?
Amazing, what you can do with five thousand ping-pong balls, isn't it?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
Look at them, Lieutenant. Everybody is a clown! How do you expect to win the war with an army of clowns?
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
He is.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
The destruction of the Amargosa star has altered the gravitational forces throughout the sector. Any ship passing through this region will have to make a minor course correction.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Sorry, sir.  There is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.
It appears to be a magnetically sealed.
All hands, brace for impact!
You're in the Nexus.
Yeah. They're great, aren't they? You can go back and see them born, go forward and see your grandchildren. Time has no meaning here.
It's our pleasure.
Risk is part of the game if you want to sit in that chair.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
What's normal?
No, I didn't know that.
I told you everything. You might as well just kill me right now.
When we went to ancient Rome for Deanna's promotion, we threw her to the lions, remember?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
Right. And they'll be vulnerable for at least two seconds.  Data,lock onto that plasma coil.
Aye, sir.
Sure - whatever games you wanna play.
... Fascinating.
All the varieties of land and weather known to Earth within a few hours walk!
... Radiation residual... Level is minimal...
But... How could they have evolved so quickly...?
I have already made one transmission too many...
Did your collaborator know?
And Spock with it. They are joined together.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
Affirmative, Captain. Our readings are well below danger level.
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
None that I can detect, sir.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Aye, sir!
Very well.  Mr. Chekov, I need pre-approach scan... Take the science station, please.
She's to be decommissioned.
About a dozen officers and men.
With some on the planet...
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Now wait a minute! This business about Spock  and McCoy... Honestly, I have never understood Vulcan mysticism -- I'm sorry! But part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... Understand?
Torpedoes coming in -- !
Perfect! That's the way it shall be!... <U>Give me Genesis</U>!
I -- saw no future --
He would not have spoken of it openly.
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
Yes...
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
Sarek!... What if he melded with someone else?!
Steady. Continue on impulse power.
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
More antiques for your collection -- Cheers!
Say thank you.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
But we can't just sit here -- !
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Are you running away from me?
Only half of you would get there.
No!
Sir, we must!  We must repair the damage. Enterprise will wait; she's not going anywhere.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
KHAN!
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Aye, sir --
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
Yes, SIR.
Aye...
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
How far?
At least we know he hasn't got it. Just keep nodding as though I'm giving orders. Saavik, punch up the data charts of Reliant's command console -- hurry...
It's all we've got.
Establish a parking orbit around the station and send me a complete damage report when you've talked with Mr. Scott.
He's intelligent, but not experienced. His pattern indicates two dimensional thinking...
I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
It is still regulation, Admiral.
There is no such regulation.
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Scotty!
Phasers locked...
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
It'll come back to him.
No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
-- That's the general idea.
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
Come on, Pavel...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
It is.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
All right. Let's take it from the top.
The top of what?
You play games with me and you're through
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Is there something wrong with the one I have?
There's really very little point in my trying to explain.
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
Hm?
What do you mean now?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
Well, I was close. I knew outer space was going to come into it sooner or later.
I'm all ears.
Are you kidding? I wouldn't miss this for all the tea in China.
Jesus, you are persistent.  Okay, your friend was right. Gracie is not only pregnant, she is very pregnant... At noon tomorrow -- in what is sure to be a media circus -- the whales get shipped out.
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
But Kirk...
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
... Damn!
What are you talking about? I'm coming with you.
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Thank you, Admiral.
Surely you can be more specific...
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Yes.
Why not?
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Thank you, Spock.
Steady as she goes...
Uhura, scan for the whales. 401 megahertz!
Ground cushion! Keep the nose up if you can --
Communications Systems ready. Communications Officer -- ready as she'll ever be.
On screen.
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
10 seconds, Admiral; 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1.
Well done, Mr. Scott. How soon can we be ready for warp speed?
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
I demand to see the owners! I demand --
That's easy: 6 inches. We carry stuff that big in stock.
Yes, I noticed. Now suppose -- just suppose -- I could show you a way to manufacture a wall that would do the same job but was only an inch thick. would that be worth something to you, eh?
Sulu Hikaru.
Why?
Perhaps, that is true.
I can't imagine what it would be like to be a machine.
Sometimes I do.
No one's ever asked me that before.
Data doesn't breathe.
Another forty-three people reported taken, sir...
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
It is not over.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
Fail-safe?
If we don't outrun them, the manifolds are going to be the only thing left of this ship.
Detonating the warp core might neutralize the cascade... but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are unpredictable. That's why they were banned.
The purpose being...?
Remind me to lodge a protest...
We're through running from these bastards.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
Transmit a wide band co-variant signal. That'll get his attention.
The metaphasic radiation in those rings is in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf...
Beam him out!
Isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor...
Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp.
Montana? Well, that answers everything. Why the hell are we --
I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
We have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try?
A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me?
Vulcan?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse...
I have the password right here.
Always am.
It'll have to wait. Come on.
Entering the upper ionospere...
Picard to Enterprise.  Picard to Enterprise -- do you read me?
You don't sound French.
There's a few of us left.
Invasion.
You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me.
Friends from Cornell...
That's impossible.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Aye, sir.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
We just lost main power... and we've got Class-Three alerts all over the ship. I'm not sure what's --
Commander... we have a problem.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Are we playing multiple choice?
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
We were until your torpedoes!
Yes.
First rule of assassination: always kill the assassins.
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Thank you, Captain.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Candidate for what?
Right standard rudder, Z plus five degrees...
Sir?
I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
There's an old Vulcan proverb: only Nixon could go to China.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
So, that's it..
Why would they give them to us?
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Not from a distance. She won't show up on ANY type of scan.
That the universe will unfold as it should.
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
An error.
Confirmed, Captain!
We've been ordered to -
Yet the data banks insist we fired: twice. One computer is lying.
That could take hours!
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
What exactly does that mean?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Yes, please continue.
Why?
It'll serve you right.
I think a skin cell’s the more likely of the two.
He turned out all right.
That is because you have a familiarity with them. You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge.
Now, you make a toast.
I can see that.
Sorry, sir.
Of you?
I do not agree. Although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created unique individual.
But so much is the same. On a biological level he is... and I will not accept the idea that there is nothing I can do. I have a responsibility to try to make a human connection with him.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
I am not.
The resemblance is... striking.
With pleasure, Captain.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
Counselor?
The one thing he may have forgotten in the course of battle: me.
Make it so.
That's an order, Commander.
Let's hope that luck holds. Janeway out.
What sort of signature?
Your new chair, sir.
A coup d'etat?
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
Agreed.
Anything.
I have dissolved the Senate.
Yes.
Come to dinner on Romulus tomorrow. Just the two of us. Or just the one of us.
As happens so frequently here on Romulus, a new government came to power. They decided to abandon the plan -- frankly, I think they were afraid I'd be discovered and it would lead to war. They weren't ready for that.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
No race should be a slave to another.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Long ago.
Our greater goal is more important, brother.
It is... invigorating.
Have the doctors prepare. I'll be on the bridge.'
They're holding position.
And?

I thought we discussed patience, Commander.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Flew?! Oh, come on Benny...
No, we can handle this.
I understand.
He's got a gun!!
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
Clarify that.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
Police...
Good.
Pancakes.
X...
This car runs on gas.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
I know.
I do not understand.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
But I speak English.
Yes.
Then don't be smart.
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
It was a mistake.
Yes.
That was beautiful.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
I must meet my ship.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
I understand.  Thank you.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
What will you say about us?
I'd like to...
Many, many days and nights...
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter.
We're ready.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
I don't understand.
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
It's always politics.  Like this thing we're in here, he's paying you to tune me up, right?  But I could pay you more not to.  See what I mean?  I could write you a check right now--
Watch and see.
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat?  Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over.  It's over! Now please leave.  I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
Oh God, Lenny.  I was trying to keep you out of this.
What a nightmare.
A virgin brain!  Well we're going to start you off right.  So what do you know about this?  Save us some time...
What kind of things exactly?
What?  Right Here?
Come on, amigo, the world's full of marks.  And nobody knows how to work 'em like you do, pal.  You could sell a goddamn rat's asshole for a wedding ring!  Let me buy you a drink.
Least you can do.
This tie cost more than your entire wardrobe.
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Shutup a second!
I was gonna tell ya.  Hey, it's just a job.  I feel like shit about it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
Looks like she was holding out.
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
Thanks, buddy.  See... things weren't bad enough.  They weren't fucking bad enough!
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out.
Mace, you're my friend.  I need you. Plus I'll give you 25% of what I make tonight.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Let's talk in the car.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
Wants to share.
No it doesn't.
That's where it gets a little strange.
And what about the guy that was following me?
Sure.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
Yeah I know.  So what do we do?
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
Aw, Mom!
Sucks.  Hey, Bobby, turn that up.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
This isn't in our database?
I just assumed she ran away. Happens a lot around here. Look around. This place is an invitation to run away.
What does the Manager say?
What?
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
Yeah.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
What?
He had an orange hat on.
This could all be a coincidence, but, you know something, I don't believe in coincidences. That's why I came back.  Do you think the UNSUB -- we're not going to mention the word Zorro -- met Harold Speck online?
Smarter than us.
What?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Who?
I might point out, Agent Mackelway, the reason we haven't been able to crack those rooms is that you refused to share that information with us -- which is also why you were reassigned.
You refused to comply with a direct order.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
He got away. I had him. He got away.
Mack the Mouth at a loss for words.
How long ago?
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
Listen to this guy? Can you believe this? He'll never change. Born a liar, first word out of his mouth was a lie. Make up a story, always a story, any goddamn story, to save his ass.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Just routine stuff.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
I just need to go a little slow.
I'm in Omaha. Get to the airport. There's been another one.
You want to get him? Find something he wants. Get him to come to you.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
Yes.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
I already have an employer.
It was the mall.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
This guy, Zero, he drifts around, that's how they all start, drifting around, their minds filling up with fantasies. He thinks he's real smart, laughs at us, laughs at his victims. But he has left a trail, and the trail is somewhere in those names. You know how to reach me.  Take my advice, when dealing with these FBI tight-asses, go by the book. That's what I did.
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Thomas Mackelway.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
Murman!
Are you calling Her?
Nikki.
I'm Mike.
Like the quiche?
Yes. Like the quiche.
Yeah.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Why not? This place is dead anyway.
Yeah, I'll tell her I don't remember and then I'll ask what she looks like.  Then I'll ask if we fucked. How's that, Tee? Is that "the money"?
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
No...
That's not good enough. I want to make plans to see you.
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah?
I couldn't. Do you know how hard it's been not to call you? I pick up the phone every night. Whenever that commercial comes on...
...the Michelin commercial...
Right.
What do you want? You're tall.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Classy.
He's a mean dude. I've seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. He knocked out his teeth... blood... He was just like Boom, Boom, Boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. He's a nice guy though.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Hey, man. I took the Kings to the Cup.
So, what? Eleven?
...He's derivative...
Believe me, I know what that's like.  Yo, Double Down! What time are we leaving?
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is... 
Trent, I don't feel like going out tonight. I got shit to do tomorrow...
What Vegas?
Tonight, baby.
Oh... Now Mikey wants to be a high roller.
Be downstairs. You're beautiful.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Vegas.
That's not cool.
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
You gotta do it.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
But I lost! How can you say always?!?
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Let's just leave.
Okay, Tee's the asshole, but Mikey's the big winner.
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
She likes you.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
That's bullshit.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
No!
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
Christy was nice...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Michelle went for you, right.
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
Yeah. He's a "rounder".
Minnie Pearl.
What?
A day.
You were good. Did you see how she was vibing you?
Chelios to Roenick...!
...Is he brown?
Baby, I know it is. It's a black diamond trail...
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...Yeah.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Sue!
...it's definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Good.  He never doubted you.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
I want you to use all your powers, all your skill, as you love me.  I do not want his mother to see him as he is.
Ba Fa Goulle.
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
No.
You understand him better than anyone.
The Senator called--apologized for not coming personally, but said you'd understand.  Also, some of the Judges...they've all sent gifts. And another call from Virgil Sollozzo.
Two terms; one in Italy, one in the United States.  He's known to the Government as a top narcotics man. That could be a plus for us; he could never get immunity to testify.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
But you needed a drink first.
What miracles you do for strangers.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
A man has to choose what he will be. I believe that.
No...I would like to walk to Corleone.
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen.  Is your wife coming with you?
No.
I was as good a son to him as you or Mike.
We should hear what they have to say.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
Mike, why am I out?
You're not a wartime Consigliere. Things may get tough with the move we're trying.
I know now.  I'll make them call me Don.
How do you do.
Sure.
What time do they expect us?
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
I love you.
Look.  I'll see you tonight, OK?
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
You just stand here one minute...
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
That's not how Pop would have played it.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Send some bodyguards.
The kid's right.
I want to settle things tonight.  I want my father left alone.
He talked to you?
Thanks.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
You just woke up!
Shut up!
I'll come down.
It's vile.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Marge, you like everybody.
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
That's three. Nobody should have more than one talent. Okay, do an impression.
Now? Okay. Wait a minute. Talent --  The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance.
No, I think your mother, her illness --
Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Now your signature.  Not "Dickie". Your signature.
I didn't mean with you in it.
He's getting impatient. He wants me to reassure him you'll be home by Thanksgiving.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
What club?
I thought you'd missed the train.
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
Really? To Italy?
How?
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think he's at dinner at 6.30pm. If you said he was still at lunch I'd believe you. Incredible. The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth.
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Which is horseshit. Have you heard him play that thing?  He can't.
Have you done something to your hair?
I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf...
Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to -- what's the word?  The moment someone confronts him he lashes out. He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children.
Such as?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
I'm sure we've met.
What's going on?
Sure.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out --  Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
How long's he staying for?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
I can explain.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh?
Golly. Who's paying for this?
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Which is?
Right.
What?
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hello Meredith.
What?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
You know what -- I am.
Ten thirty?
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
You try. You try talking to her.
I give up.
Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
I know. I'm lost, too. I'm going to be stuck in the basement, aren't I, that's my, that's my -- terrible and alone and dark -- and I've lied about who I am, and where I am, and so nobody can ever find me.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
Even your fiancée...?
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I can believe that.
He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Kris Kristofferson.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Hello, Betsy.
Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues.
How long has he been there?
This I gotta see.
He's Black, OK?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
With the other hand, right?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..."
A real skunk.
That's the guy. Eddie calls him up and says, "Hey, what do you want me to do. I'm over here at Poly Prep. I got a girl in the back and she doesn't have the fare. She wants me to come in back and collect. What should I do?
In the jungle. 122nd.
Nah.  I suppose not.
Well... I guess so.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't like my real name.
I musta been stoned.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Pittsburgh.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
He's worse than an animal. Jail's too good for scum like that.
You a narc?
Do I look like a narc?
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Why, thank you Travis.
Also clean.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Anything you say, officer.
Iris?
Things got ya down?
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Archbishop of Canterbury.  Imprisoned and executed by Henry the Second ...
You suppose?
Wrong.
Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Whatever happens.
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
Well...
I do?
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Nine hundred...
Well, there's got to be a way...
Oh.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
I do.
Peter Kenneth Appleton.  Hollywood, California.
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
Give the man a hug, boy!  That's your father!
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
The days of the storefront grocery are numbered.  I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket.
Mother.  She's beautiful.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Ha!
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
She's very pretty.
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
Why not?
It's wrong, Leo.
No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble.
Nineteen-oh-nine.
Some of it might come back to you.
Yeah... me too.
'Course they all know me.  And I know all them.  Town's got my name, don't it?
No.  Absolutely not.
Cathy?
It's a lovely garden.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes.
Would you like some brandy?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
I don't understand.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Take them.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
I think they'll be all right, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
Lois!
Daniels.
Yep?
I need her exact name, you see.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Thank you.
It's nothing.
The crow is a permanent resident throughout its range. In fact, during our Christmas Count, we recorded...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Whose side are you on?
Yes, very.
Yes.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
When do you think they'll come?
That's a chance we have to take.
I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here.  Let's bring that wood in.
But they'll be back.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
You don't have to.
Do I sound foolish to you?
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
I couldn't ask you to.
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
I'm awfully sorry.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Yes?
Yes.
We... we went to school together. College.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
I'm sure.
Dinner's just about ready.  We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
He was watching a ball game on television.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Do you expect me to believe...?
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
Really? Tell me about it.
Certainly, of birds.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
The past fifteen minutes.  It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
What time is it?
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
Mitch...
Wait here. Don't move.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
What were the crows after at the school?
For what purpose?
No one called it a war!
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
They made some mess, too, smashing into houses and everything.  They always make a mess. We're better off without them.
Good.
Good morning.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
I've heard of it.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
I saw the woman whose son's body was delivered last night.
You see, it is completely out of the question.
I can't believe that.
You've no thought of going there?
No.
Not yet.
Well --
I'll not do it, Gray.
Oh, yes, you will.  You'll do it to oblige Fettes and myself.
No.
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I suppose we can't prevent that, Gray --  -- for auld lang syne.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
Wait, Toddy. That's not hospitable. I want to discuss business.
It comes at intervals.  They used to be months apart -- but they've been growing more frequent --  much more frequent.
See here, child, when you have this pain in your back, where is it?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
She would if she could.
Did it spoil me, Meg, my lass?
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
I'm not dying for your goddamn illusions. You got that? You think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? Bullshit. She was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? You're nothing, Corvis! Less than nothing.
I'm thinking... that explains a lot.
I believe they call it a connoisseur's club. Owned by DELT.
This is not just some "thing." It's A C zero zero five.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
There is no scar. I'm telling you.
How can you die if you're already dead?
That locket you're holding. You have one just like it.
No...
I don't want to see!
It's what Lauren would do.
It's not. I can't take it.
Good for you. You do know something.
The dead can return, given sufficient motivation. And Corvis has that.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
Lauren called me that when we were little. Daisy. No one knew but us.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
Would you care to be more specific?
Yes.
What do you mean, dear?
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Tell me what?
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
Some places that's what people use for money. They're easy to carry -- and they don't wear out.
Would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
Our problems are very complex, Mr. Klaatu. You mustn't judge us too harshly.
Your impatience is quite understandable.
Are you crazy? After what happened today?
Goodnight, my dear.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
It won't work.
I -- I thought you were--
You mean he has the power of life and death?
We came to see Professor Barnhardt.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
No -- no, thanks.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
You gotta drive!
What's Plan B?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
That's just the way we like it.
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
Whattaya mean?
Maximum body-count.
Star?...
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
I can't do that!
Vampires, my friend.  Vampires.
No, I just like to read the <u>T.V.</u> <u>Guide</u>.  Read the <u>T.V. Guide</u>, you don't need a T.V...
Oh... I was just... having a look at your truck.  What's all that wood in there for?
Did we have a date tonight?
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
For what.
For everything.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
I watch him all day.  The only time I have more myself is at night.  Let Grandpa watch him.
Okay.
Wait a minute, kiddo.
Can't.  Got plans of my own.
So many times, I'm starting to think it happened to me.
Lucy.
Hi, Thorn.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Did you want to talk to me?
What do you mean?
Michael's great.  I like Michael.
Okay.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
Save Laddie first.
Nowhere.
No.  On the phone.
Nothing!  I didn't hurt him.  <u>He</u> bit <u>me</u>!  This is <u>my</u> blood!
Maybe.
Well... there's still some cell activity... it's not entirely dead yet.
Anybody sick?
You can't let anybody leave!
I've got six dead Norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we've just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  Now fuck off!
Well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
We'll see...
Cool it, Palmer!!
Ain't it there?
Wasn't enough time.  Generator was out, what...?  Thirty minutes. Takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
The dogs?
He's gone already!  Do it!
Garry's missing!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Gee, thanks!
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
A day or so ago... I guess.
Palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Mac, where the hell is that pump!!
Can you think of any other tests?
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Get your gear on.
You know damn well what we both make of it.
I had an accident.
'Fraid so.  Just a regular old... mud carrier.
And everyone looks like us?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
It frightens you.
How are your dreams now?
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
I will...
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
A man can change his history.
I'm a foolish man.
Oh, you won't be running for long...
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
What's happening to the moon?!
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Emma, you know I have great... admiration for you.
Dance with me...
You know I can't.
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
It's only a machine.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
There are some things I need to say to you.  You may not like hearing them, but I don't know if I'll ever get another chance --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
Do you find her?
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
I can't do that --
In a week... we will never have had this conversation.
Thank you...
Yes.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
So you can use it now?
Do you have it?!
May I get you some --
Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
New Yorkers.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
But... what about Starks?
Should we be...
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
I don't give a shit about your patient!
Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we didn't at least try to.
How?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Just do it.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
After I...
I know.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
There're no cars on this street.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
112 Orchard Way. [Realizing, in a whisper] You're not coming back, are you?
Ok, I guess.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I could try to...make it stop.
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. [Sincerely] I didn't know about everything that went on here.
I'll die either way.
What about the world?
And how do you know that?
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
You have nothing to fear, William.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
Why?
Good.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
[Beat] I do it.
So you never knew your mother?
Have a good day at work today.
Uh-huh.
You want anything special for dinner?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
Aw, God.
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
How are things goin' out there?
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
Alright.
Why don't we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
I have no problem with that.
Somebody's butt is gonna bar-b-que.
It's him.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
The women are armed, Hal.  This is standard.  Now you stay calm here. These boys know what they're doin'.
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Louise is alright.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Well, first you pick your place, see, then I'd just sit back and watch it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz on in...
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
Who's your friend?
Louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  I come back, nobody knows where you are.  Is Thelma with you?  Darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he's gonna kill you both when you get back, he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her if she is.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Maybe.
Maybe.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Then what difference does it make if we stop?  Come on.  I never get to do stuff like this.
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
So this is all my fault, is it.
My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Yes!  I believe I am!
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
I... I...
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Idaho?
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
What little dogs?
Suck my dick... Boom!!
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate.  You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
Yeah, you want it?
What?
What do you mean?
Eeuww.
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
We can live in a hacienda.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
What?!
Way up ahead!
All this for us?
Say you're sorry.
Fresno.
You heard me. You already put a fucking nick in my piano.
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Hey, look on the bright side --
Huh? But why did Healy?
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
I am?
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
People get hurt that way.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Yeah, that's more or less what the others said, too. Out getting coffee... supposed to meet him here... picking up my grandma...
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
Am I?
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
You said it, mister.  I gotta go.
I work with retards.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
A surprise?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Any idea where I might start looking?
You don't buy what?
She's blackmailing you, right?
Three different guys?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
Do what?
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
You're a sick man, you know that?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
I never said that.
Oh. Well I am.
What's that supposed to mean?
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
Hi, Ted.
We've got a lot in common.
Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She just left for the prom with her boyfriend Woogie.
It.
What?! No please, sir --
I wasn't trying --
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
What --
Yes, sir.
I want a consensus, Bobby. Consensus. Either air strike or blockade. Something everyone'll stand by even if they don't like it. I need it by Saturday. Make it happen.
That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
We got a bunch of smart guys. We lock 'em up together in there, kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options.
What does the letter say?
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
Cuba.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
Still heading for Cuba.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
A thing like this... who could even think of winning?
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Wrong, and you get to wax my car.
Not as far as the election goes.
All right. 'Cause you get armed boarders climbing into Soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
-- did you understand me when I said that --
No, Ray. You're gonna have to blame that on your grandmother.
Seven.
We'll have to give Leo a refund. Because he's gotta go to the M.E. In case you don't know, Officer, violation of the Major Crimes Act on --
I've got the doer. I know who he is.
Cooch. What's the Fort Laramie Treaty?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
Watch out!
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux. What did he say?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
She's your sister?
A what?
What'd you expect to hear?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Why? So you can get rid of me, too?
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
Well, it was just a dream, I --
What the hell do you want me to do?!
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
We're going for The Stronghold.
You're the FBI. That's your job, isn't it? Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never saw any investigating then. Why now? What's going down here?
I desecrated it?
Go ahead, Ray.
They took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
-- your father was part Sioux.
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
No. Can't say that I have, Richard. Richard do you know why I'm here?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
Red Deer Table! What's with you, man?
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
I heard of one once.
Yeow!
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
Two miles.
Two meters.
You let me make a fool of myself.
There you go with those moves again.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Lieutenant...
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't have to kill it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
Winston Churchill.
And now?
Anything.
You ever fly an F-14? 
That's what you get flight pay for.
Not to me.
It does.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
I was, later.
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
Right on the flight line?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
This is crazy!
What?  What is it?
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
No! Now we're inverted!
Roger, I've got it.
I can recover. Hold on!
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Well what?
Hey, see any controls back there?  And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
I wouldn't call it victory.  It's more like...self immolation.
I want him!
I can't eject.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Figured out what?
Just below ten thousand.
But you continued to fight.
What the hell you doing?
Bad?
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Oh, you mean the thrill!
I called your house.
I know.
The Last Resort.
How'd you find me?
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Yes, sir.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
Why not?
I've been trying to tell you.  Someone erased his memory.
I'll do what I can.  It's getting messy in there.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  I'm sorry to tell you this, Mr. Quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. We can't snap you out of your fantasy. I've been sent in to try to talk you down.
Not since you lost him.
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Rekall?
They sell fake memories.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
How was your trip to Mars?
I'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
I've got Quaid.
Quit while you're ahead.
Let's do it.
All right, forget about it.
Lori, move.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
Doug...
It was implanted by the Agency.
How real does it seem?
You couldn't get me a message?  You never wondered what happened to me?
There's something I have to tell you...
This is too weird.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Why would I lie to you?
Get out!
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
What reactor?!
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
Yeah, whatever they are, you'd think after they ate all those sheep they'd have to take a dump someplace...  What the hell's going on in town?
I'd go for penetration.  The 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
Right.  We're gonna run.  Get ready.
Yeah, I'm lucky it didn't find <u>me</u>.  This is important, you know.  This is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  The century?  Forget it.  <u>History</u>.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
You gotta ask <u>that</u>?
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
I'll go with that plan.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
I think we wait right here.
Maybe it is.  Why don't you take a little stroll and see?
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Like hell you are.
Not yet, not yet...
What?
You are so full of shit...
Forget it.  I got vegetables coming out my ears.  Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain't so much as <u>seen</u> a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
If that ain't the truth.  And I count on them for a little bit of stew meat...Thank you, Fred.
I think I'm gonna be sitting up with her.
We're in deep shit over here. Let's change that plan.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
It's...gone...!
Could be.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah, vibrations in the ground.
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
LET'S DO IT!
Too fine, Badalato. The bad news is, you're gonna live.
The hell you do. At this hour?
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
You fucking swear to shut up!
Of course.
What, the lunatic who --
"Have to"? No...
There's no one else to talk to. The tattoos were phony!
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
-- Eddie...
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
I am. Eddie -- we've got nothing.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Exactly what happened then?
But why?
Maybe... because someone's afraid.
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
Good. Now we're going to take an affadavit from you, but only concerning the facts of the Chinatown shooting. We honestly don't give a shit about the Kennedy assassination.
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Let's not drag the Constitution into this.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
Your Honor, I know as much about these gangs as anyone; I'm well aware of the secrecy in which their machinations are cloaked... I assure you this witness offers the court a rare opportunity to place the defendant's crime --
I hope so, Mr. Reynard.
-- What trial?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Mr. Ortega... What is "La Compania"?
And why was an exception made?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
And you b-believe that.
A woman.
NO! GOD, NO...
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
No, hey, I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff "Not-Quite- Able"... Here's the trailer now.
That's right. That's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
Ever see her with someone else?
Did she ever mention any friends?
Jack and I are united in holy matrimony.
What happened to her?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
No one could find those splinters without a machine like this. And no one had a machine like this.
It is a piece of paper with the letter "T" imprinted on it. Take a look.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
You want a muffin?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
I haven't got it yet.
Yep...  Yes...  It is.
Oh, yes... yes...
I'm not.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
Why? It does.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
You know it and I know it.
Everything, but everything.
Trees?
Did you come home during the day last week?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Who am I?
Don't worry, Shelly, I'll handle Leo.
Abrams...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
We thought it was just.
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone. She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends -- and the people who should care for her: her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way. We have been paid to look the other way. I came in here to take your money.  I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.  I can't take it. If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.  I can't do it. I can't take it.
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Well, we...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I completely understand...
Hold on a second.
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Yes. Yes. I think so. I hope you'll be comfortable. I'm putting you up at my...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
...What difference would...
In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
...Deborah Ann Kaye...
Right. Who called?
Whose side are you arguing...? I thought that you wanted to do something. I don't have any interest in the woman's 'estate' -- No offense, but we all know where the money's going to... I have an interest in the Hospital; and I don't want those bozos working in the same shop as me. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. They turned the girl into a vegetable. They killed her and they killed her kid. You caught 'em. Now: how many others did they kill?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
I understand.
You live in the neighborhood?
Yes.
Yes.
What did she say?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes.
...things change.
I don't have a week. This case never should have come to trial. You know better. You're Mr. Independent. You want to be independent? Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Defense...?
What?
Listen to me, fella...
And don't give me this shit, 'I was a lawyer, too.' 'Cause I know who you were. You couldn't hack it as a lawyer. You were Bag Man for the Boys and you still are. I know who you are.
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Yes.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
And what makes you so tough?
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
This is Miss Costello...?
Nothing happened.
I didn't do it, Mister.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
What do you want?
...I'm going to need your help...
You need my help...? You need a goddamn keeper... are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred-ten grand?  Huh...? Are you nuts? Eh? Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
I'm going to help her.
I know what I said but not now. You won it. Franky. You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won. We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
...Gruber's not bad.
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
I can't talk now.
Gimme the address. I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
That's right.
We got to talk.
I don't know.
What happened in those three...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
Me, too.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
But I think I know where she'll be....
It hit sideways and skidded in.
They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close...  I take them off.
Can you handle one of these?
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
I'd like to borrow your car and take a look at it in the morning.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
You mean that was a...
So I don't know about horror.
And I...I've got other things happening.
What?
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Like weird calls, by any chance?
You get any sleep last night?
Heather, has there been another call?
Absolutely.
Oh my God...
Rex woke me up. He was fighting.
Right 'cross the freeway.
I'm fine.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
Yeah...how'd you know?
When do you think it'll be done?
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
No.  I...listen, I can't make it in today.
'S okay.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Captured?  How?
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Coffee'd be nice.
Guilty.
On the deck of the Yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  We weren't much older than they are.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
I mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Yes.
I know you will.
Fine.
Of what?
They have every right Chuck.
I don't know.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
Oh, really?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
Come on, he didn't mean anything.
I don't have to listen to this.
He didn't get to be Under Secretary of the Air Force by being neighborly.
I don't know...
I understand.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Yeah, well, if he says that all that flab turns into dick at midnight, he's a liar.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
Twenty.
You was in the Marines, huh?
Sorry to hear it.
No.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
Forty bucks...
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
No, of course.
What's the name of it?
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
Yes. Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach San Pedro Sula, who is named after Cary Grant, and he told them there was a shooting.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
My daddy ain't never killed nobody, has he, mama?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Stab it and steer.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
What's that?
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
You up for that?
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
We got through two states already.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Yeah.
More'n likely.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
You're scarin' me, baby.
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
Love you, too.
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
In international news, India plans to release crocodiles in the Ganges, the holy Hindu river in which millions of people bathe annually, to scavenge for corpses, authorities said.
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
Like hell.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
What do you want me to do about it?
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Whattya mean?
Life is unpredictable.
I didn't see nothin'...
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
We're going to the men's room. Only we might not make it in time.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
You're welcome.
Oh, I'm sure you'll find another. You always do.
Shut up and drink.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
What's to tell?
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So what's the problem?
Oh! Huh. Exactly how do we do that?
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Or Hemingway, when Hadley lost all those stories.
In a sense.
I peeked.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
Bullshit.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
I've been trying to finish a book...
And your wife left you.
Relax, Vernon...
Shoot.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
Really.
Maybe. I'm feeling a little sad myself tonight.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
Most of the time he is, James. Some of the time he isn't. Now what do we have here?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
It's not that. It just reminded me of -- you know -- of what's in the car. In the trunk.
Thanks for the halo, James, but I've never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
Jealous? Of me?
I never said that.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
No thanks.
I eat.
Nowhere. You just sit here and... eat.
Near Carvel?
I'm a little worried, James.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
She's left before...
She's left the room before. She always came back.
If she's not now, Terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
Well, no, I don't see any way.  And I know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
All right.
That... and you.
Grady.
Would Walter really press charges?
I said it didn't sound like you.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Oh?
What's that?
This is important.
Oh... yeah.
Her husband.
As a heart attack.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
A jockey? You mean, like --
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I doubt it, darling.
No shit.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
No way, man, you'd rob me blind!
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
Huh?
Yeah. It's really nice.
Then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
It wasn't like that.
Don't talk like that.
Why not?
The mother sure has her hands full.
Were you watching me?
Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
Why don't you just tell me?
If you could, you would have brought one today.
What?
The one with the ax?
I don't know.
That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
The assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.
Yeah.
What?
Lovers' quarrel?
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Do you have many friends?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
They sound like finches.
What will happen if I do?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
I don't mind.
Ev-i-dence.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
It's okay.
Why do you think you're here?
Is that what you are angry about?
I suppose it's however society defines it.
How do you define it?
They usually tell me.
What did you think would happen?
I said I was sorry.
We're little kids.
You felt pleasure.
It was a small house.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
Accept you?
I feel... okay.
I'm all right.
I'm talking about you.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
The worst?
It's not what you think.
Twelve years in prison?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
What?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
I love my brothers.
You never asked them about it?
I'm not scared.
Just think about it.
Do what?
Sneak up behind me like that.
Do you want to talk about it?
Where're you?
Not for long.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
No.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
All right.  Do it!
Turn it up, bozo.
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
Bud, it's the pressure.  Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice.  Just listen to my voice.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
But why rattle your brains by arguing and talking... Believe me, Anna, words never help at all. They only serve to confuse. I love you, Anna. Isn't I that enough?
And what about yesterday... at my house... didn't you have any feeling for me, even then?
Oh, very well. I'll just spend the weekend alone by myself and take a little rest. I should be used to it by now.
You already know what they are.
You mean Sandro, don't you?  Well, I beg of you, please, spare me that. Goodbye, Dad.
Sir, if you have no objections, may we start the search?
Have you decided?
More so than the shark?
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
How should I be ... arrogant?
But of course... arrogant, haughty... Hasn't Anna ever told you?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
It takes even less.
Are you joking?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
Tell me once more.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
It was futile. We went all over.
Do you consider that a compliment?
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
But for what reason should I come there?
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
Really! So that you can stuff it with your geraniums.
Well, we're still in Italy, you know!
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
Because this is a Chinese radio.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
I know, dammit, I know!  And just think -- if there ever was a woman so right, so perfectly cut out for all kinds of dissipations, degradations, infidelities... of.. . of... of debaucheries, it's her. Well, anyway, she's faithful. Faithful out of laziness... of unwillingness.
I would like to ask you something.
Through someone else?
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
Who?
Yes, of God.
Should you see a doctor?
Anything... may I sit down?
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Oh, there are so many.
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
I don't know.
And then what?
From their heads...
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Would you like to ask them?
One.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
I don't know.
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Do you?
No.
Yes.
Like you?
I was a mistake.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
And you're unhappy.
No...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
Are you pretty?
Are you intelligent?
To help me.
It came out of me.
Did you want it to come out?
Why?
Because I was afraid.
Why were you afraid?
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
We went to chapel for vespers.
What else?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Yes.
What did she mean?
Agnes who did you see?
H... how?
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Marty, what are you doing here?
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
You have proof?
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
No. We work the land alone. No-one but Sister Marguerite and I are permitted contact with the public.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
I can beat that.
No-one.
Yes.
Yes, but I...
Look, someone gave her the baby.
I believe Agnes is different.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
So, someone else could have done it.
I've already told you what I thought.
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
About two years before.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
Aquittal.
Visitors to the convent.
Oh, Dear God...
Sister Paul?
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
Her spiritual health.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Stupid woman... and that's all?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
She is an innocent.
That's what I have to believe...
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Yes.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Wasn't it!
Lay them down.
Your cards... lay them down... face up.
They are?
Eight and two thirds.
All right, take your hoop and bowl.
Are you now?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
How about Ding Dong?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Aren't you supposed to be in that box?
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
Grotty?
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
Get him out of here!!
Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!
Wake up!
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
The big hammer?
No ... I wouldn't say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
Pity.
What's that mean?
A book!
Have they?
That sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. I'll get the boys. Hold on son, I'll be back for you.
Me!
That's what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.
Lip reading.
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
He can talk then?
Every morning.
That's all right then.
Oh yes, he's clean all right.
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
That little old man.
He's got you worried, then?
Oh, it's a laugh a line with Lennon.  Anyroad up ... It's all your fault.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
He started it.
No ... he's must have slipped off somewhere.
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Come on speedy!
Oh you do, look.
Have done, and you lot get your pens out.
Do I have to raise me voice?
Down the ... er ...
Nerves.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
He can't be far.
I'll set John on you!
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
Sandy, scan the whole sky.
Is it solid?
What's up?
Take a look.
What is it, I can't --
You want to try?
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
Don't you remember?
Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name.
Hard to say.
It grows on you.
You know what they make this stuff out of?
Is it alive?
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
You just sealed it off; it can't get to that section.
Yeah, but how?  His nose and mouth are blocked.
It's eating a hole in the floor!
We'd be sitting ducks in the freezers.
Good.
At least it can't get up here now.
Can you get them back?
Who knows?
Is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?
The commander normally has first publication rights.
Room by room, corridor by corridor.
That tube must be depositing it in him.
About four hours.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
No -- that's atmosphere.  Cloud layer.
What killed it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for.
It's some kind of organism, it's attached itself to him.  Let us in.
Chaz, listen to me -- we've broken every rule of quarantine.  If we bring an organism on board, we won't have a single layer of defense left.
Broussard had film in his datastick, didn't he?  We can see what happened to him.
Even simple.
You win.
Let's be democratic.
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
I'll get you out of there.
What can I do?
Nah.  I just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'Sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they're protected.  They'll dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
Oh man...
It's on the board.
I dunno.
That's impossible, man.  This fence is high-tensile.  The breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. I know, I put it up.
Fuck the bonus.  I hate heights.  You wouldn't get me up there even if it wasn't night.
Auto-shop?
Uh-huh.
How tight are these shafts?
You've checked that end?
How many... how many people are missing?
Okay, I pull the access panel off of the console.  Insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
Didn't feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
Four.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Don't wait for me!
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
What time's sundown?
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
It wasn't meant to be.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Lloyd and I.
She's always been so fantastically devoted to Lloyd. I would imagine that only death or destruction could keep her-
Lloyd Richards is commercially the most successful playwright in America-
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
I don't know what I take you for anything...
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
Champion to champion.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
That's not true!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
You can have one at Max's.
No, it's not.  It's for this.
Exactly.  Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
Like I just swam the English Channel. Now what?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
Hear, hear...
I was there. An eyewitness.
It wasn't reading, it was a performance. Brilliant, vivid, something made of music and fire...
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
How childish are you going to get before you quit it?
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
You're my girl, aren't you?
That I am...
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
I'll check with Eve...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
Cut it out.
For instance what?
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Okay. Mix.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
I don't have to. I want to.
You didn't have to tell me.
It means concentration of ambition, desire, and sacrifice such as no other profession demands... And I'll agree that the man or woman who accepts those terms can't be ordinary, can't be - just someone. To give so much for almost always so little...
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Why not?
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
That's all.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
No, dear. Margo must go on.  As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Why shouldn't you?  Please sit down.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
You talk just as Addison said you did.
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Of course.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
The heave-ho.
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
What about Bill?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Well... all right.
Margo. Margo's great. She knows it. That's the trouble. She can play Peck's Bad Boy all she wants, and who's to stop her? Who's to give her that boot in the rear she needs and deserves?
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
That's quite a change of subject.
I'm beginning to catch up.
What are you going to wear?
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
- and for my feelings in particular! For my play, my career - and now for a frightened, hysterical girl on the eve of her first night in the Theater!
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
I will.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
I thought you knew... She was put on over a week ago-
What do you mean?
I mean really, deeply angry...
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
Go ahead, please...
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Promise.
--it was fine the way it was--
Mainly it has to do with your choice of words.
And you haven't called him?--
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
Facts or theory?
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
'68.
Nixon.
Go on, go on--
--Colson.
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
--he said John Haldeman, not Bob Haldeman--
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Sir, I'd like to ask you a few--
Oh.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
Whatever.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
And you will.  But not now.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
By "they" you mean...?
I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
What do you want to know?
My non-denial denial.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
--you have nothing more to say, I understand that.
...check...?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
--don't you miss the grand scheme too.
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
James McCord.
Will you step forward, sir. 
Are you sure?
It is.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
You can't believe that.
Howard--
--go over your sources again--
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
No, it was good.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Like what?
...okay...
When was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
Neither did I!
You'll see.  Gotta go.  Sixteen minute round trip.
Easy, tiger.  What's in there?
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
Do I have to?
You don't like it?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Well, State's got a good business school.  And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  Green peppers?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
No.  I'm missing the game for you.
What's that?
I know, it sucks!
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
I think I've had one.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Yeah, enormous.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
I'm not going.
Yeah.
You're not...busy?
I know.  Hey Nadia.
What was your name again?
Whatever you want.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
After high school.
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Nadia, I can't --
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
This just got a hell of a lot better.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah.
It did.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it.  And that leaves you trailing, Jim.  You gotta get your act together.
I don't care.
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
The key is don't look down.
But you better hurry.
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
No it isn't! You're dead!
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Andy!
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Andy! No!
Fuck me...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
You too.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
And you call me a moron...
What?
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Yeah, I finally "checked out", thank God. But there's a bit of unfinished business.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
You fucking liar!
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Merde.
No.  I'm running <u>to</u>.
Who's Sophie?
You must have.
I shant!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Who are you?!
Trying... to... breathe...
Sad?
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
No! Well, yes, but
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
No, no child... shush... it's all right ...
No, he just wanted to know you were happy.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
How do you know?
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
My Aunt Bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "Curses were made to be broken". Course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
Evil, powerful beings - I have their power only if I contain them, control them. If they should all be released at once... well ...
Please, if you'd just listen...
She does.
Oh, heavens - I must say, yes.
You didn't read "Death in Venice" till I gave it to you!
Alvy, you are totally incapable of enjoying life.
It's okay.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
Oh, no, I have a car.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Huh?
Well... thank you again.
You sure?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
Oh, sorry.
Duane?
Oh, I see, I see.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
And we'll digest our food better.
"There goes another novel."  Jesus, you were great.
Yeah?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah.
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
You don't want me to live with you?
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Yes, it is.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
David? You call your teacher David?
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
David! David! I can't believe this!
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
Thing?
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
Yeah.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
Oh!
Can I confess something?
Step up here!
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Why are you so hostile?
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I have a headache.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
May I see your license, please?
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
Well, hi!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
It was a wonderful set.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Oh, I was quite a lively dancer.
It's the way they do things.
To code?
The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I?  Wouldn't I?
And you've only just met.
Who, Sally?
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Didn't I say?
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
I'll change back before we leave.
Don't you miss it?
Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two.  Can you help me with this stuff?
Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy.
Can I open it?
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
Just did.  Jealous?
And?
Fuck you.
You have to sign your taxes anyway.
Well it's fucking time.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah?
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Not as a rule.
I love you, you're a genius.
I adore him.
I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
There's still time to undo this.
Whatever you say.
Scout's honor.
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'm going to throw up.
Otis!!!!
This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
About me!
What?!  You aborted our child?!
Me too.
Sure.
She'll never call again.  She called last week to tell me she'll never call again. Where's Sally?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Oh yes.  Nineteen...just.  I'm cold.
Come here.
Sorry?
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
I'm so sorry.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
I so wish I'd known.
I'm so sorry.
Oh great.
She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours.
You see, that's worse.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
What does that mean?
Um.  Happy for you.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Yes.
I don't have a drug problem.
Not nice.  Not kind.
This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  Why are we even digging this thing?
Who cares, Z.  All I know is, we gotta dig.  We're not the ones in charge.
I'll make myself available...Listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  I don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  I'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
You miss him?  <u>Why</u>?
Well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes I am.
I'm Princess Bala.
How should <u>I know</u>?
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Well I guess that makes us even.
And only you can become a Queen?
Let's dig in!
Well, I...I know it's a little strange, but...I thought it might come in handy if I...needed a scarf someday.  Well, to be honest, I just liked having it.
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
It's just that -- well, I'm honored that you selected me, and everything, I just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
Yes...he's wonderful...
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Something the matter?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Good night.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I forgive you.
Cheers.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Three.
No -- I like it.
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Miss Kubelik --  -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Two o'clock.
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
What's her first name?
Give what up?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Was he really upset when you told him?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Gin.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
The dishes?
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Think.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Oh.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
Sir?
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Oh?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
So what's it going to be?
Thank you, sir.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
You threatening me?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
How many pills were in that bottle?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
I'm not sure.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
What about him?
Who is Mickey?
Family?
No.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
I took sleeping pills.
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
It won't always be like this.  I love you, Fran.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Atlantic City?
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
He wouldn't.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Captain Willard -- go ahead.
Look -- we got in a little trouble -- they rudely took our helicopter for MedEvac work on this -- uh Operation Brute Force -- They just brought it back this morning.
Dreadful.
Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell --
Good -- like I said, take your pick.
Part.
Let's talk about you.
Tracks ?
God knows.
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Would he remember you ?
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I've worked with them on occasions and I saw the movie , sir.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Well, he's killing now.
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
I said it's a good swell -- hell of a good swell 'bout six feet. Let's get a look at it.
How big it is?
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
Hairy ?
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
I met him.
The enemy. Who else?
Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's.
I'm Kurtz.
What do you mean, Colonel?
That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'
The truth that you were sent here to murder me, ans so far you haven't done it. And do you know why?  Yes, you know why.  Your mission makes about as much sense as those idiots who sent you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! How long does it take you to figure out that nobody knows what they're doing here.  Except me.
I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want.
Yes...
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
Were you with him, when...
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
Then Philippe will have to kill all of you.
Right now -- I am.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
C'mon --
150  CONTINUED:
26   CONTINUED:  
Sure did.  He was one of the trappers we rousted from the Haul Road.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
I thought I should check our emergency transmitters.
Fairbanks is a three-hour flight. I'll be back by dinnertime.
You can't stay here.  Go back to the Turtle.  I'll meet you back there in a few hours.
I'll tell you everything later.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
-- Turn around.
Too bad we're heading west.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
You got one?
Too bad.  We'd be out of here in a few hours.
All you do is keep folks from working the land, living like they're meant to.  You don't understand shit!  Trappers, hunters -- we're part of the environment.  Who's protecting us?  I've seen plenty like you.  So -more-
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Uh-huh.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
No!!! Stay away from me!
I was working...  can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
One baked -- one fries.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
Yeah... Well...
Okay. Good-bye.
Were you asleep?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Okay.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Why? What have you been thinking about?
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
So am I, Frank.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him.  I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer.  Have a nice day. Party!
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Think white and get serious.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
What's he look like?
No, I didn't.
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
That cleaning woman doesn't...
Got any easier questions?
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Yeah...
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
Picking on me won't help.
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
How long have you been freelance?
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
All right, Bain.  Pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
You would be.
Sick.  The flu.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
What do you mean, 'that's all'? What in the hell do you know?
An assassin?
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  He is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  He will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  If you keep a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  If you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
Just Electra?
Because I'm done.
Better than playing with yourself.
Where you wanted to be?
I was just different.
Then you went freelance?
Are they usually like that?
No.  Something honest.
Good.
Thinking.
Yes.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
Sorry.
You should.  It's very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
Cheap as shit.
Okay.  Then what?
It will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  He will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow I slipped by and am already on a plane to Europe.
Except --
For Nicholai?
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Yes.  Here I am again.
Five million dollars will buy a lot of Rolaids.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
Why?
Who was she?
What happened to her?
After her, I realized that to survive I had to live without... It's dangerous to let things become complicated.
When I gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
The point is, they are paying for information.  Real information.  Not tooth paste brands.  Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
A dime.
Go ahead.
This will take some time.
Hey Doug, you want a beer?
Naz dravi!.....What do you like about this place, these people, Chris?
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
No, better than me. You know, I have many friends, you should meet more of them.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
Puppet theatre, don't you need something a little bigger?
And put it on expenses?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
I thought that was part of the charm!
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
I've been saying that since we met.
Nope.
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
It just happened.
He's lying! I am.
They ain't the only ones.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
You're kidding.
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
Do you want me to see what's on them?
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
Some deal you did there!
I should have read the fine print.  I love you Holly, thanks.
Here!
In return for Doug's freedom, I was never to see him again, I had to - it was his only chance.
Sure I'm sure!
Follow that Budjovice sign.
So am I.
I've been around.
Let's have a look anyway.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
Ah, so what?
How?
Deal!
Insurance!
What is bail?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Uh-huh!
It's Josh's.
And you broke into that room?
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
It was the biggest I could find.
I'll need to make a phone call.
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Well come on, sit down.
Why?
You bastard!
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
With you.
Heart be still.
I'll tell her you were here.
About a job.
Thanks.
No. I won't be long.
That'd be something.
No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Were?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
Do you think I'm strange?
That is my telescope.
In 76 years, me neither.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
And why would that scare me?
It means you can do anything.
Fun.
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Twice a year.
Away from here.
Where's the one you're building?
That's what I mean.
Tired.
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
It was a play.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Thank you.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
Have we ever met before?
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
But he didn't ask me.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Oh yeah.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
Five cents, please.
March 11th.
Pro! Release the rope!
Why?
Don't you understand? The mere act of sending matter back in time would change the course of events, and changing history is a responsibility that I do not wish to bear.
Must have been? Used to live? I do live here.
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Oh -- that -- I found it in the closet.
I brought it with me from 1982. It's from my science book.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
That's just what I needed to hear.
Perfect...
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
Hell no! The way my mom carries on about sex -- you even mention the word and she goes into cardiac arrest. You shoulda seen her face when I told her we were gonna stay up all night Saturday, he added. Always afraid something is going to happen.
Yeah.
You expect me to believe that?
No, he showed me one.
Yeah.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
What's your friend's name?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
No.
How bad off is he?
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Yes.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
Yes.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
She wants a picture.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Let her out. In my custody.
Now!
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
Who?
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
Absolutely.
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
You look!  It's not here!
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Pictures don't lie.
Garland, it's me.
I – I've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
What else?
Ever act?
Then who should I talk to?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
No, what did it say?
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Very important, Garland. I just thought you should know that. Whatever happens.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Pictures! Jesus!
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Seen a doctor?
Ready... wrestle!
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
Are you sure –
We gotta call the police –
Charlie! I've got no one else here! You're the only person I know in Los Angeles...
Yeah, but Charlie –
Because you DON'T LISTEN!
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
Anyway, I had Lou read your script for me.
I had to call Beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  After all I'd told him about quality, about that Barton Fink feeling. How disappointed we were. Wally was heartbroken. The man was devastated. He was – well, I didn't actually call him, Lou did. But that's a fair description, isn't it Lou?
Also known as Madman Mundt.
All of which he's now missin'.
Physician, heal thyself.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
You're on leave, man.  You're on psycho leave.  I'm talking to a possible whacko here.
I'm fine.  Come on, Beth!  You know I'm fine!  How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
She said what you said she'd say.
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Are you arresting me?
Yes, you do.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
I don't know.  But you do.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Do you?
Don't get too cocky.
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
Ice?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
What do you want from me, Catherine?
Yes.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
It hurts.
I know.
Try me.
It won't sell.
Why not?
Somebody always does.
I told you.  She kills him.
Why would I need an attorney?
He had a girlfriend?
Somethin', though.
You don't like punk rockers?
Why not?
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  Oh, man.
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
We bring her in for questioning.
What about me?
No.
First you've got her buying your file.  Now you've got her killing Nilsen.  Forget her, willya?  Go someplace.  Sit in the sun.  Get away from this goddamn fog.  Get her out of your system.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Did you check all four years?
Only if you're making it.
No. Should I have?
Let's get out of here.
Ignorant art?
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
I don't like beer.
No.
You name it, I paint there.
It's OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at Mr. Chow's later. We'll be there.
What do you mean?
Decipher?
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
Well, you said that.  You've got a lot of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don't you?
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Willie Mays.
Who am I?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
Oh – you mean black people!
Yeah... I'll paint on it.
Good. What do you have?
Guess I just got sick of him.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
Basquiat, what did you take?
Forget it.
Yeah, it's the best one.
It's three thousand dollars!
You like your dad's paintings?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
I didn't know.
I need this?
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Yeah?  Me too...
Had one.  Didn't work.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
You first.
Weird, huh?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Mayors come and go.  And heirs tire easily.  Really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with Muhammed Shreck.
I'm not scared of you, Max.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Fred.  Fred?  He's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
... Want 'em to go apeshit.  Nutso. Ballistic ... Do permanent damage to little old ladies.  Loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>Sounds</u> fun.  But I ...
I think you'd feel out of place at my party.  You see, it's for winners.
I don't.  So, no.
No, I am.  Yes, I'm boning up for your Bruce Wayne meeting in the morning.  I pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment... I've studied up on all of it ... I even opened the protected files and --
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Alfred, am I pigheaded?  Is it always my way or the highway?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
That, sir, does not compute.
Pheromones?
Passion.  Of course.  Find the photo of Ivy after the flower ball.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred's happy here.
Happy.  You honestly don't know, do you? You can't even see what's in front of your own eyes.
What exactly are you doing?
We have eleven minutes to stop Freeze And thaw the city.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
No, Robin.  He's going to jail.
Open Sesame...Chicken.
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
Is that it, Bruce?  I'm under some magic spell?
I knew you could handle it.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Let's cool it for now.  There's someone I want you to meet.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
That is far too merciful.  Batman will watch his beloved Gotham perish, then I will kill him.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
I shall be near at hand. Should you need me. And sir, I know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
What?
What?
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
And another name for Mystery?
Enigma.
How ya doin', Al?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Did Two-Face call him Bruce?
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Precisely. What's on all our minds? Brainwaves. The future of Wayne Enterprises is Brainwaves!
On occasion. Usually at night.
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. If you're jealous...
I always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. But it wasn't. The real fear was hiding underneath: what I read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. That's what I couldn't remember. That's the crime I've been paying for all these years.
You don't understand. It's an addiction. You fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. But the pain's back in the morning. And somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  I want better for you.
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Of course you are. And what a grand pursuit you must be.  What do you think of my new invention?
How could I forget?
Just call us Harvey. Can we get you a sandwich? A soft drink? Given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
Never heard of a double-cross?
A man with a death wish.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I see.  If I know how you really feel, I won't like you as much.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Do you still think the Joker cares about money??
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
All aver the world.  They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Bruce Wayne?  Date?  He called you up and asked you for a date?  Shit.  HEY, MIRANDA!  C'MERE!  Now pay close attention to this.  Miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about Bruce Wayne.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
I've had it with you.  I'm leaving.
Jesus, Vicki! Where is it??
Holy shit. Holy...
There aren't hotels?
Did you really ask?
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Meaning?
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
Ahm.....
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
Bravo.  Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  Don't want anything to go wrong.
Sure.  You're right.
They're pretty.  Learn it in the army?
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
Not at all, Governor.  Very striking.
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV. Heh heh. TV.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
This sucks. What are we doing here? Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and score or something?
C'mon, Beavis, just start running really fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
Turd-burglar...
Butt-snatch...
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished. It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose camper they... I mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
We've run a sample through the National Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father. 
That's why I'm bussing it across America. I'm so glad you're here.  Jim, I want you to meet two nice boys.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
You'll be rich!
... Hmmm?
I know.  I'm sorry.
That's all we need.
I don't know... what are you looking up?
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Little black party dresses?
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
Give or take a year.
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Start simply.  Do what you know. Use your talents.  Practice.  We only help those who help themselves. Just do a little at a time.  And of course, practice, practice, practice.  It's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
Well, we didn't know --
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Yes.
You people have really screwed up!  I received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  And you let Betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let Otho get ahold of the handbook.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
I'm beeyoo-teeful.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Stepmother's...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
<u>This is not a joke</u>!  That sheet was full of ghosts.
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Otho, can you do it?
It wasn't a joke.
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
What happened to the people who used to live here?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
An attorney?
Yes.
Then you wish to handle this matter through your attorneys?
It's fine today, Robert.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
He's resting comfortably now. There's no cause for alarm, yet...
I think we'd better go look for him.  David!
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
No. I like it here.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
... Mentor...?
Thank you, Eve.
Yes, Eve. I know that.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
Thank you, Eve.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
Yes, that is correct. I think you should ask Mr. Rand that.
I don't want Robert.
Oh, good.
Yes. I like that very much.
Yes. I am very hungry.
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Bravo!
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Yes. I like to watch.
... Sir?
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
I never needed money.
I see.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
You're welcome.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
No.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
No, Thomas. But I have seen the Army on television.
I think you do, Mr. Chance. However, I will reiterate, this house is closed and you must leave...  Call me if you change your mind about signing.  C'mon, Sally - let's grab a bite...
... Spring and summer...  Yes, I see... Fall and winter.  Yes, indeed...  Could you go through that one more time, please, Mr. Gardiner?
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
No, that won't do any good.
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
Right, Chief.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
I'm afraid so.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah, okay.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
The monkey.
Hmmm.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Us, of course.
Me and John.
Shut up!
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you’re implying.
Yessir.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us?  You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see.  Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Yeah. But enough about me.
The usual, Barry.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
What kind of circumstances?
Why are you being like this?
Fine. Let's drop it.
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
Never heard of it.
Whatever you're having.
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'm getting better all the time.
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
You mean with Malkovich?
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Say the Word!
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
YES.
They treating you right over at the Bodwins?
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Thank you.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
I'll make sure she does. But first I'm going  make up a nice, big breakfast against that cold outside.
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Go upstairs I said!!
That's Baby's kin. I don't need no invite to look after her people.
I know Denver.
Might see anything at all at 124.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
What run him off? Tell me that!
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
No use thinking these things now.
Leave off..
She was only-
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
I'm telling you don't say nothing to me.
Make it the way I always do.
Yeah. Too sweet. 
We have the urn.
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
And this guy peed on it.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go into the tournament with this negative attitude--
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Lebowski on the right?
Heh-heh--
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Mm.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
Oh yeah?
Thank you.
You're not interested in sex?
You mean coitus?
He fixes the cable?
Well--sure, I could do that--
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
No it's fine, really, uh--
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
Uh-huh.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
I want a child.
Huh...
This was a valued, uh.
What the fuck are you--
Theodore Herzel.
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!
Am I wrong!
The man is a sex offender.  With a record.  Spent six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight- year-old.
Huh?
The fucking point is--
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
Well call them up and explain it to 'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking simple, I'm sure they'd fucking understand it!  That's the beauty of it Walter!
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
This whole fucking thing--I  could be sitting here with just pee-stains on my rug.
No, I'm--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--
Huh?
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?
Who the f--have you ever heard of a little show called Branded, Dude?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out there after the, uh, the.
It is a fucking emergency.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax-- YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell happened?
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.
Come on, Walter!.
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.
Dude, I'm sorry--
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You're just looking for a handout like every other--are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Huh?
Bunny.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Walter!
Survival.
The House of Pain.
Fry 'em.
For what?
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I am a hunter.  A weapon.  It's what I do.  It's in my blood.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.
It means I'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. You've been acting strange ever since I gave you the cure.  Reckless, quick to anger --  You said it yourself, Whistler.  Those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards.  Where'd they get their intel?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
So?
Getting your attention, Paco.
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Our operation?!  Our operation?!  I built this operation, you fucking turd stain.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
Just do it, old man.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
You sure now? I bled a newborn for this. You won't find a drink that's sweeter.
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
You've been here longer than you think.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
That's ridiculous! No one's that powerful.
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
Graffiti --
The way they move, they way they smell --
I'm just tired, that's all. We've been up all night.
It's the only way. You know that. We'll never get out of here alive if you don't.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
You've been listening in the whole time?
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
What do you mean?
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
Then there she blows.
No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
Oh, sorry, right.
That's a joke?
That's its name. A pastoral glade gamboling with crackheads and homeless and averaging at least one homicide a week.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Yes.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
--you should get back into bed.
Whatever you want.
It's my fucking <u>job</u>, man!!
Fine.
If I could do that, I'd be at the goddamn racetrack, not here.
I got a friend at a Lab. I could get the whole thing blown-up, enhanced--
What?
No.
Not a great idea. Especially 'cross the street.
What?
Gimme it!
Next time try putting on shoes--
--Domini!
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
This isn't about us.
Look over there.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
Two-to-one he dusts the keyboard for fingerprints the second he gets back.
What?
I know, I know--
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Get some more beer.
--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
--yes--
Yes.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
Where... where you going?
On the phone. Was it for you?
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
...Mm-hmm.
...You ever get tired?
What the hell happened, Ray?
...What was that?
Remy.
You've got a very sophisticated palate.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
What?
Listen, I ain't a marriage counselor. I don't know what goes on, I don't wanna know... But I like you. I always liked you...
I told you. I like you.
Well now you do.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
...What?
Got something to show me first?
Then you shouldn't have done it. Can't have it both ways.
How would I know?
Right.
This.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
You shouldn't have taken the money...
I'm not sick.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Anything you can tell me?
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Who knows you have these?
Only you. and the photo lab.
From the neighborhood?  Shut the fuck up.  You like telephones? Huh?. You wanta go for a ride?
Frank?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Nobody.
Then you got undressed.
Yes.
No.
See my nipples?
Don't say that.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
No.
Yes.
I sure don't hate you.
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Kiss me.
Yes.
What?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Yes.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
Terrible. boring.
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
No. this has been going on for some time . several months. About six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. They were from people who were reported missing. They never found one complete body. only parts.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I don't know. he moved away.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God. I shouldn't have told you.
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Yeah.
Are you sure?
Okay, okay. Bye.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
Did you see her undressed?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
You want to go talk to him?
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Frank!!
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
Go ahead!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Well, most guys don't. I mean that's the point. You all mind if I take my vitamins?
Yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
On the plane.
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
I'm taking you to the doctor when we get home, and I don't want to hear any arguments.
It's garbage.
It's garbage.
Excuse me?
We want some grass.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
And I only deal with you?
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
You?
I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's going to blow an O-ring.
Get me a six pack.
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Because I got caught.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
Great.  I love the Bahamas.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on parole.  I can't leave the state.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
What is it, George?  Because I have to get home.  I've got a parole officer waiting for me.
Pablo used his influence.  Now, George, watch what you say.  Everybody hears everything.  A lot of things get said and done that, well, let's just say this isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you know?  No offense, but you know what I'm saying?
Right.  Now who is the person in California?  The connection?
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
Cocaine?  How much?
Today.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
It's beautiful.
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
I'm sorry, George.
Of course, George.  We are beautiful. We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not like Diego.  We started this, George.
I know.
Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way you look at me.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
Figured what out?
We sell it.  I got it all figured out. We make three finger lids and sell them on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a lot of weed for our head.  What do you think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies and everything.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
But this is...
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Do what you want, it's a free country.
I don't know.  Maybe California.
But I've got school.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
I know, Dad.  I know...
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand dollars, and I have no more concerns.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
That's right.
Don't be such a pussy.
It depends on you.
I understand. What's your question?
Which "district" do you belong to?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
You've got to change occupations, Hacene. Right away!
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Then don't complain.
You still haven't told me why you didn't let me kill him.
Sure ...
Here?
I think it'll be a success ...
That's true ... Wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... This is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all Algerians, count them and measure their strength ...
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
No -- but I got something.
What'd he die of?
That's what my report will read.
A massive cardiac arrest.
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
It would be an added stress to his heart.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Like cats and dogs.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Alright -- I'm going to allow his testimony.
You may call your next witness.
Counsel approach the bench.
Aren't they all?
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
I didn't hear it.
You get his statement?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes.
His Secretary.  Joanne Braslow.
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
Yes.
For about one year.
Intense.
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
I had a bad heart.
It didn't.
Why not?
She left me.
Who was your primary beneficiary?
Thank you.  The State rests.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
I was angry.
You called him?
We dated for about a month last year.
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
That bastard!
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
Yes.
Well - I'm a little confused.  This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.  It's dated the day of the murder.  Is this your signature?
P.M.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I need to ask you a question.  What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
We're not animals.
Sure.  Where to?
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
No -- you're not.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Really.
He could let you have your vacation.
Yes.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Daddy -- stop it!
Oh Jesus.
I said NO!
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No. You can have them.
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Well, what am I supposed to think?
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
Oh, yes.
She used to be so friendly.
Heat is not heat! There's different kinds! And this heat is much hotter than what they got in Michigan. You go and call your brother and see if he don't say the same thing.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
WHAT!
Want another cigarette?
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
You get used to it.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Okay. See you later.
No.
What?
I had a temper.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in. 
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
Uh-huh. And?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
What about us? What about me?
Later. Go back to sleep.
It's only four days.
I just want to say... I know you had your own dreams. I'm sorry I couldn't give them to you. I love you so much.
The man said just to use my imagination.  Let's see...yeah, I get it.  Potential. I can see it now.  The first major urban theme park.  Village Ghetto land. Kinda like Legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  Totally E-ticket.
Go for it.
You wouldn't know a mule if it bit you in the ass. And personally, I don't need a mule.  I got a Lexus.  And nobody gave it to me --
That's some terrible shit.
Yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  Just be glad I did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Let me see your hand.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
No baby.  I'm serious.  Cancel that meeting.  I got more fruit that needs checking.  Come home with me now.
What?
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
No brother.  I wouldn'ta.  I never done a man - any man.  Let alone a brother like that.  Course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  Now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  You about to find out.
I have to finish this for class.
Nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
And what's that?
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
What else does she say?
Nothing.  You'd think she was crazy.  And she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy Momma's not.
Way I figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total B.S.  And our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Here!
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
From what?
You were just a kid.
Daddy?
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Fuckin' comedian.  See you tomorrow.
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
We're all tired.  Everybody makes mistakes.  Tomorrow in the daylight, everything's gonna look different.
No, no, Caesar.  Not now.
All right!  Where's the key?
Where is it?
All part of the business.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
What are you, drunk?
It couldn't have been.
All right, Caesar.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
Violet, I won't let you leave.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Caesar, what are we going to do?
They're just cops.  Stall them as long as you can.
He can't kill you --
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Shut up, Violet.
Good boy.
But everybody is all right.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Sure, Gino, sure.
It's all right, sir.
Why?
Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Okay, sure, Mick.
Leave your phone on the hook.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
My pleasure ...  but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
Truck.  Of course.
Sure.
I don't understand - ?
We're not that different, Corky.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
For what?
What?
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Who is Gino?
...  shit.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
okay, all right.
Hey.
Hey, Johnnie ...
Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay?
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
Forget it.
You're not doing shit.  You're so scared you can't even think.
What do they want me to do?
I don't know.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
What if I say no?
Then I'll find another ride.
I'm sorry.  Really.  What do you want me to do?
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
You're paranoid.  You were shot. It's natural.
I don't remember any of this.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
I guess so.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
See.  It's starting to come back, yeah?  You mind if I take a bath?
Go ahead.
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- forget it --
I don't know. 
You could do that?

Abbott wants to talk.
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- we're evacuating the building --
I don't remember Zurich.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
Central Services don't take kindly to sabotage!
Well not exactly. But, if you help us we'll help you. The Forces Of Darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
You must save the day.
Oh, right ...
Well ... well, I ...
Triplets.
Layton! Oh shit!
How much do you know?
Sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but Buttle's heart condition did not appear on Tuttle's file. Don't think I'm dismissing this business, Sam. I've lost a week's sleep over it already.
He's a compulsive heating engineer. A maverick ex-Central Service repair man with a grudge against society. Now, fortunately, we're nearly out of the wood, I think. At least we will be when I get this Layton woman under arrest.
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Yes. I'm impressed.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
Trust me.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
Where do I get it stamped?
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
If you say so.
It's you ... it's you ...
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
I didn't like it.
Where are you taking me?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
They'll be there waiting.
Get away!
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Are you sure?
It's not our mistake!
Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
You want to take my console into your office?
A woman eh? I see.
Actually, I've decided ...
My complication had a complication, but Dr Chapman says I'll soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. Are you buying a Christmas present for your mother?
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Thank you for calling Cen -
No need, sir
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have to go through the proper channels.
Have you got one or haven't you?
I've never fired anyone in my life.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
She's having a baby. Twins.
You can trust me on this one.
Mary ...
He's not a cop, he's a medic.  I'm CY Coates.
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
You're going to live.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
He's going to be all right, right?
IB Bangin.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Five years.
I think I'd remember that.
Maybe I should come up with you.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
I need a drink, that's all.
I don't want to hear about it, okay? That's three jobs for the night. It's over. Three jobs and time for a drink. Six am, the cocktail hour. Pass the bottle; I know you're holding.
Burke. You won't believe it. He's showing cognitive signs. He started with spontaneous respiration, now he's fighting to pull out the tube. Had to sedate him. He's in a CAT scan. I'm giving him every test I can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
Can't tell. It was a breech, twins. The other one seems okay, though. Marcus is taking him and the mother to Maternity.
How many times have you shocked him tonight?
Crazy fucker.
You have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
Don't worry, kid. Tom'll take care of you. Put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. Listen to the music. El Toro de Oro. Andale. Pronto.
You okay?
That's your job. Just keep driving, keep moving. No stopping. We're sharks. We stop too long, we die.
Frank!
They'll just keep calling.
One more time!
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Fifty, right?
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Why?  What did they do to you?
I don't think so.
Why?
Eventually rising to...
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Do you feel good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
This is important to me.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I'm going to take it.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Yeah --
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
Thanks.
The cost-efficient reporter.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
I spent a fortune on this.
No...no.
Yes, it's true.  They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
No.  But, honest.  What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks?  I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
That would be great.  It better help.  What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
I was a lot earlier.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to.  I have about two thousand questions for you.
Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
Yes, sure.
I don't write.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Because you're nuts.
That's not it.
Okay.  Good night.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
You fucking...
Right back to you.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
Uh-huh.
Oh it's enough...
Without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
Anything new?
You know it.  I'm out of here.
Ready?  We've got plenty of time.
Hm...
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
No! I want to talk about it now!
Is it?  I've forgotten.
It was.
Don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
I admit it.
Well, I've been thinking...  I didn't realize how much...talent Walter actually had.  It would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  Dead wrong.
You're right.  We should build a collection first.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I do the research.
I know, man.
But it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
I said I did, didn't I!
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
What am I doing?  I'm just telling Walter the truth.
You want me to open a window or something?
It was.
Never mind...
Well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
I can't talk right now.
What do you want for it?  Two thousand? Three thousand?
Can't you see I'm busy here?
Uh, hi.
Hi.  I know you!  I've seen you down at the Jabberjaw plenty.
You can cut the crap.
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
Why not?
It would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
Gee.  Thanks.
Oh no, that's OK, I can fix myself something.  Besides, I got something important to do...
Noise Mrs. Swicker?  What noise?
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
Cheer up.  You may still.
I don't know.  Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
Would you sleep with them?
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Yes.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Come on, what was it?
So I noticed.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
I think you've forgotten something.
Buffy.
Hi there.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Get away from me!
Who's afraid?  Besides me, I mean.
Like what?
Please.  It's so '91.
Where?
Yeah, whoops I came.
Am I in trouble or something?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
I have cheerleading squad.
It's true.
Our purposes.
Why do you keep saying that?
Well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky.  I mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  They're like --  -- the mighty oak.  It's not a look.
But you enjoyed it, yes?
Put your head back.
They were vampires?
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
My clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
All right.
He knows who I am!
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
How do you not tread on the earth? I mean, you kind of have to.
Yeah... She's okay, though.
I guess.
B'bye.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
Yes, I'm sure they do.  This place is everything you said it was, Amilyn.
Swear to God.
You are much more.
You think so?
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
Okay.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
I gotta bail.  You coming?
Wit-tay.
He is so bald.
Oh, please.
Weird?  You mean like you hanging out with that homeless, Poke?  I saw you last night after the game.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
A little better.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I'm trying to play with your body!
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
I won't be needing these anymore.
We all deserve to wear white.
I don't dance.
Crash, I didn't think you--
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Let me.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
Why not?
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Ninety-five miles an hour...
He'll learn.
Oh both of you, of course...
The socks?  It's cold in here.
Will that work for me?
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
Call me a cocksucker and you're outta here!
Well, I held it like an egg.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
The moment's over.  If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Why am I a fuck?
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300?  1 got it figured out.  Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points.  Okay?  There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
I ain't hitting a man first.
We'll be praying for you.
You can do anything you want.  Hop in.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Check it out.
I put in a word for you with the organization--told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday...Might be an opening at Salem next year--
Jim looking for somebody.
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Was I at that dinner?
You were wandering around.
This is a very auspicious occasion.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
The worst was Blue.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Uh, I'm not. Sam, I wouldn't...
Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Okay.
Help, Daddy!
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Oh, no, please, please.
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
How did Nicky collect?
Eight.
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
It was so obvious. I mean, all of Nicky's half-assed mechanics, they were real signal happy.
So what do you think I do? I threw that cocksucker out.
What? Ho-  Hey, come here.
Nope, there's no way.
In other words, I'm fucked.
You should say so.
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
The point is that she's upset. She's - and you got a fuckin' problem.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Yeah, that's right, the way you need me to vouch for you as a citizen and get you out of one of your jams. I'm gonna have to straighten out what you just did with this guy.
What people! What'd you think, I wasn't gonna find out?
I -
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
And what'd she want?
She was afraid to call you.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
Believe me, if I could prove it, he would be under arrest.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
You've got to stop her.
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
We have some nice penthouses you'll enjoy. Maybe the Presidential Suite.
Thanks a lot.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
If not for me, at least for Amy.
I don't need one.
No, you don't.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
Right.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
How serious?
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
I'm not -
Not gonna let me in?
But it was just mine.
No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please.
Mr Rothstein.
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
God! 
What?
And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
...I got muscled on the street.
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe. I want to go to see The Elephant Man.
Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma?
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
He won't...
Please.
...fuckin' jerk-off.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Bullshit, I ain't goin' anywhere with you!
Why, does it look like it's bothering me? What do I give a fuck?  Fuckin' Oscar too. All the fuckin' money I've given that prick, he don't even look over here. What's his problem?
But I'm just trying to leave.
I'll tell him, Remo.
Hm.
He's good. He's fine.
You see... I wouldn't want to be jeopardizing anything for people who are our friends. You understand?
Okay.  Frankie, you're a good boy.
That's enough now!
Keepin' Remo happy with money was the greatest insurance policy in the world.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
You know... the first time I ever saw your guys together... I never saw him so happy. I mean, I know he's a crazy Jew fuck and everything, but...
Sure.
Am I right?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Sure did.
Is that what you want?
Yeah.
What about my money?
Okay, yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Come on! 
I'm always here for you.
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
You got money. That's a - That's a good look.
He called you right here.
Of course.
Stacy. 
Remo.
Let 'em complain. I'm the one who's here.
Yeah, what'd you tell him?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Fuck you!
Well, I'm a little confused here.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
I know it, I know it.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Yew'll be ovah in the naxt tehn minutes...
Guilty. I am.
You're probably right.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
Your warehouse?  Go on ahead--to your "warehouse." I'll be okay...
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
It may be time to get the police involved...
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Winning.
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
Well. I stand corrected.
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Yeah, as in born before..Ooh, I suppose it's "sexual harassment" to give a woman a compliment. Sheesh. Come on, gentleman...
Uh. "Thanks?"
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
You can't figure me out. You're the strange one..
Then there's you, Louis, sneaking through back alleys and surprise visiting me at my home..Both of you have been way too frisky from the get- go. I'm actually a pretty amazing person--funny, smart, attractive when I get my sleep--but you two had no way of knowing that-- when I met you both I was basically a morose, depressed amnesiac incapable of any human feeling. The only reason one of you wanted to go out with me is because you knew I was Catwoman.
Maybe.
Uh, it's just--that woman out there-- that horrible Hag. She's the one who keeps following me on her creepy little scooter--And now she's built a hut in the back..Why did you...
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
This is one way.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
How was I in the wrong?
You gotta just look the other way.
It's taken care of.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
You don't understand.
I can't talk any louder.  They might hear.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
Don't expect me to tell you who I am.
Listen, there's an overpass coming up.  I may lose you for a minute.
What are you doing now?
Hey drop it, okay?
Lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
That's not her.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The one in Brentwood.
The City National on San Vincente.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Even if you found us -- what then?
Lucky for them they didn't.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
They wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
Put the man back on.
Yes.
Shit.  I'm sorry.
Hand me the phone.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
Assure them that you're being well treated.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Some people fall apart in a pinch. But you shine.
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
As a child I hated being told how sweet I looked.  That angelic little face wasn't me at all.  I had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. Sometimes words were enough -- but I wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who I was.  That same look you gave me when I turned the gun on you.
How about "later?"
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
He let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
Who is this?
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
We don't see you.
I'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
It's in the process.
My pleasure --
You'll still have the girl and the husband.
Are you trying to panic the women?
Call me "Nels."
And if you ditch us we get zilch.
The fuck I will!
There's two police cars now.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
I thought you'd know me by now.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Five minutes.
We're gonna get there first.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
Government business?
He's what she should run a mile from.
He gave me a look.
What do you think his name is?
Fucking men, Col --
C'mon, babe! You know what I like... Easy!
Who the fuck is he?
Cunt.
Scottish?
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
What look?
They're jealous.
Like what?
How special?
How different?
Do I?
Want to look after you.
Why?
He looks after me. He's a gentleman too.
I know that.
How?
Whenever. Tonight.
Thing is, Dil, you're not a girl.
All right, they do.
Are you pretending yet?
Please, Jimmy.
I miss you, Jimmy.
Don't be cruel.
Only if you kiss me.
Delirious.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
Anything.
It's a secret.
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
My pills...
Prescription. For my condition.
What condition?
Don't go like that.
It was you...
Okay.
It's my name, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
No, what is the thing?
You're never out, Fergus.
And what happens then?
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Some judge...
I sincerely hope so.
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
The poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
And do you know why?
What?
And who's Dave when he's at home?
Fuck you, too --
And who is she?
Just a girl.
It's a knocking-shop. Tres discreet, huh? He visits his ladies on Tuesday and Thursday nights and Saturday mornings. His security's in the car beyond.
Right.
How is it a farce?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What is it now?
Why can't we?
What do you know about my nature?
And you know the funny thing?
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
My inside pocket.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
I got sent.
The fastest.
These things take time, Fergus.
Doesn't matter where.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
The best.
What?
Go to Millie's Hair Salon in Spitalfields. Take her to the Metro for a margarita. Don't have to tell her who you are. Just tell her Jody was thinking --
What does that mean?
Hurling's a fast game, isn't it, Fergus?
Faster than cricket?
You don't know me, do you?
Nice lady.
Give me the fucking shooter!
No -- I guess not.
Well -- come on.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
No, what?
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
He looks so young -- when was this taken?
No.
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Brian.
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Oh.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Open it.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Come here.
What are you doing?
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
What? Assassinate somebody?
I dare you.
Fiction or non-fiction?
Well!
I don't believe it.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
You don't s'pose one o' us has it, like the man said -- I mean, that'd be pretty distasteful -- us bein' vet'rans o' the same war 'n' all.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
Leave?
I'm very confused.
I don't know. I suppose so.
Where did he keep his money?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
It is all right.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Quitter.
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Peter Joshua.
Yes.
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Are you in the book?
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Having a nervous breakdown.
Who said?
What was it?
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
I believe what he said.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
I'm glad. But what's all this?
He took care of Charlie for us.
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
We want that money -- now!
I just wanted to check that you were okay?
The kids adore him. They confide in him. His patchouli reeking rear might know if Stacy and Rod were really virgins. Why didn't you ask Jody that?
is there anything you do?
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
It won't happen again.
I've been in the same class with Stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.
Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty miles west of here. Over the Indiana border. I'm going.
Did you warn her?
You know where I can find her?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.
I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
Really?
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn party I've ever seen.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
No!
OK. increase the peace.
The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
I kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. It'll be a lot less scary. You have to go.
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
Don't you think it's sick?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
You know I want to go with you.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Yeah. Who is she?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Not that I know of.
The library. I'll be fine.
How could you?
I've regretted it ever since. Never run with the herd just because they're the herd.
What?
And she didn't?
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Well I'm trying to be real here and you're mocking me.
Okay, okay.
...shit.
EXT. ROAD - DAY.
Where do you want this stuff?
Great. 
...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Hang on.  Hang on.
Look, if I don't get this stuff to McGruder, it's goodbye, Andy's Ice Cream, goodbye, Jerome, goodbye, Mon-...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
All right.
You are not takin' my truck!
Come on!
It happens to this piece of shit...
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
I ain't goin' through Missoula!
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  You stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...


Oh...
...gun?!
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
Oh!
All right, you got it.
You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 
Come on!
Get over!  Get over!
All right, you got it, you got it!
Whoo!
Hang on!
 Shit. 
 Go on.
Okay.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
...man!
Oh, shit.  Okay.  Come on.

Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Worth a try.
...truck.
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.

 Whoo!
Hey.   Mason.
...man.
Bring him down!
Hey!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.
Okay. 


Go!
Okay.  Okay.
Okay.
 
 What's it say? 
What?
It's working.

Who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept Elvis cool?
Us.  Owes us.
...us.

...about him.
Don't be tedious, waiter.  Dr. Long called it Elvis.
And it won't be pleasant. 
It's, uh, parked just off of Highway Thirty-Five.
  Hey, actually...
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
Exactly.
Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
No, sir.
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...and the government.
"Went away."  I like that.
Good to see you again, Leo.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
I'll do it.
Radio the bikes.
...-ther orders?
Move!
...here!
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...

...general store.
...-fall.
...screwup?
You don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  I mean, Long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  The stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
...gear?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
....-lene.
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
Assumptions are always dangerous.
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared...
...never done a thing for you?
Bring him up.


...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
I can handle it.
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Uh, we both like to fish.

All right, let's move...
Pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  Now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.

Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...

EXT. ICE CREAM TRUCK - DAY.

INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
Heat's murder.
They're calling it an accident.
Very.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
His girlfriend?
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
I didn't realize you and Hollis were so fond of each other.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
What is it?
Yes... I think I can manage...
Then why are you doing it? How much better can you eat? What can you buy that you can't already afford?
Who do you blame for that? Her?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
Off the alley.
Could you drive me somewhere?
How are you, Lou?
Oh yes.
You're welcome to try. There he is.
When I do, you'll hear about it.
Absolutely.
He found out somebody was dumping water there. That's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
Shut up.  Go on.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
I said I'll drop it.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
I'll stop by.
...Just a minute...
A check?
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
She's cheating on him.
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Where you were when your husband died.
I can't tell you.
More like other people putting their business in my nose.
Wait a minute, sonny.  I think you better come with me.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
The one your husband opposed. They're conning L.A. into building it, only the water won't go to L.A. It'll go here.
And Hollis knew about it?
Why?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Doing what?
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...No. Why was it.
The Albacore Club.
It has to do with my father.
C'mon, Mrs. Mulwray. You've got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
On his day off. Get the exact address.
He didn't wear bifocals.
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Ida Sessions.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. It's nearly bedtime.
I wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?
He never even kids about it.
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
I said, the northwest valley.
I don't want to nail you. I just want to know who put you up to it. I'll give you a few days to think it over.  Call me. I can help. Who knows? Maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
Didn't you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
What about the water?
That's a long fall.
I am sorry.
...Yes of course.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
Gittes.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Since lunch.
Gee whiz.  And I'm late.
He did or he didn't?
He owned it.
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud. I only heard one thing – apple core.
Gimme your keys. Watch this old fart, will you?  Take Duffy's car. Curly's boat's in Pedro, near the Starkist cannery. It's the Evening Star. He'll be waiting. I'll take care of this.
Neither do I.
No, you have a press agent do it.
Progress! It always arrives too late!
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
No. And nobody knows where she is.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
We'll talk about that later.
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
For what?
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Then where's the money?
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Go on!
I can't take shorthand.
I ordered six already this morning! Got a discount!
I know.
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
Yes, very!  Naturally.
Well, well - isn't that nice?
-  We thought maybe, if we can find out what he meant by that last word - as he was dying -
You know why?  She was so -
It's not trick to make an awful lot of money if all you want is to make a lot of money.  Thatcher!
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
That looks pretty nice.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Hello, Bernstein.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
I'd rather Mr. Kane withdrew without having to get the story published. Not that I care about him.  But I'd be better off that way -  - and so would you, Mrs. Kane.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you!  Mother's looking after you!
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
Oh, me -
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Would you sing for me?
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Charles, my time is too valuable for me -
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Persia.  It belonged to a king.
How did you get him to part with it, Mr. Kane?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Charlie -
Charlie -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Why, Brad?
You almost convince me.  I'm just drunk enough to tell you the truth.  I have to be a little drunk for that because I'm a coward.  You know that.  That's why you keep me around.  You only associate with your inferiors, Charlie.  I guess that's why you ran away from Emily.  Because you can't stand the company of your equals.  You don't like to admit they exist - the other big people in your world are dead. I told you that.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Oh, yes.  I know about Mr. Rawlston.
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
The banks are out of luck, eh?
Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
Unnhh!
This? How long have you been smoking?
A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try.
Exactly.
No, don't!
I'm not pregnant.
No, you're not really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on.  What smells like shoe polish?
But you were.
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'm going to fit in all of the other stuff.  I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...
You lie.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
He's your fiancé.
Pack of cigarettes.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Are you open?
What responsibility? You're closing the fucking store to play hockey.
Why are the shutters closed?
Bunch of savages in this town.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Your mother.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
Me pulling a can off some moron's fist.
The Emperor.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
It would stand to reason, yes.
Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.
There's more?
And you figured it out?
So?
The quest isn't going well?
Can we talk about this later?
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
The milkmaids.
Which ones?
All of them.
Veronica!
Shut up!  Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
FUCK!
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
Don't yell at me, pal.
I just want to play hockey like I was scheduled to.
Then where're we gonna play?
Gatorade.
"It's not like we're gonna sell out."
How? When?
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
Number six.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
How'd he die?
Come on. Haven't you ever tried to suck your own dick?
Let me borrow your car.
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
Jesus!
What'd you rent?  Best of Both Worlds?
I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
What did she say?
You're a snake.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
It's hard to swallow.
Jesus.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Same time. What about you?
Excuse me?
Yeah?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
One seventy-nine.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
I've had girlfriends, but all they wanted from me was weed and shit.  Shit, my grandma used to say, "Which is better: a good plate with nothing on it..." No, wait. I fucked up. She said "What's a good-looking plate with nothing on it?"
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you.
I'm trying.
You know the insides of those are filled with stuff that gives you cancer.
No, he got hit by a bus.
Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.
Oh, be real! Would you... Would you please hug me?  I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on.
Why do you say that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Really?
And I actually date you?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
Three.
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Lower your voice!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
Goodbye, Dante.
Really?  You're the best.
Thank you for being rational.
Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class.
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
What're you talking about?
You've been talking to her on the phone for weeks!
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?
A fine, for five hundred dollars.
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
He's your cousin?
Wait, there's more.  Olaf: sing... 
That's sick, Dante.
I hope it feels so good to be right. There is nothing more exhilarating than pointing out the shortcomings of others, is there?
Screw you!
How long you gonna be here?
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
I know. I've been here since eleven.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
I will. Take it easy.
Bye  That was Snowball.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
What usually eats a banana?
A monkey?
It can't fly in this weather.
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
Love's a killer, isn't it?
You're getting warmer!
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
My pleasure.
That's it, you look like a professional.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
He doesn't want my help.
How'd you get up here?
Of course I do.
If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
Up ahead.
What?
Helluva time for vanity!
Hold on!  Hold on!  Reach up!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
Who the hell ever is.  This is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. These bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
You're the boss.  Let's head out to the tarmac.  Matheson, have you been totally briefed?
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
We should be.  Everybody wants what we have.
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Yes. They want to help.
Who are they, sir?
Julian. This will be these people now. Alex gets up.
Hullo.
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.
You've not been to school all week, son.
A cup of the old chai, sir?
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.
No, sir, I feel really great.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
Oh, aye, aye.
I'm gonna be sick.
Blue eyes?
No, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
You mean like going to the pictures?
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.
I was quite enjoying that.
Good. I'm glad
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more. The Tramp starts singing again.
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Dad... It's the treatment. More retching.
Sixth is faster.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Yeah.
You need a vacation.
Soon.  But I take little ones all the time.  Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
In my office?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Oh, my, yes.
'Fraid so.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
It's nothing.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
Vincent...
Vincent.  It was nice to meet you. Visit again?
I was just tryin' to...to...
Who is this?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
An apology.
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
His hand moved!  His goddamn hand twitched!
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
What'd he do to you?
Who was he?
Tens of thousands killed before sundown.  Nobody's killed that fast since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Did you bat an eye, Max?  Join Amnesty International?  No.  I off one Angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Yeah.
That what we're doing?  Flowing?
There's no way I'm taking you to see my mother!
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
You get benefits?
Your lady friend.  The one who gave you her business card.  Think she was just being polite?
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Let her go.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
I, uh, I have some problems.
Mekong, my friend, Mekong.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
You're the boss.  Just don't make me repeat myself.  I hate that.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
Arf... You gotta help me.
As opposed to?
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Yes.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
Yeah.  I think so.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  Hmm... Ahh...  Ooooo...
What is it with you and the space program?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. <u>Spies</u>.  Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating.  Just like James Bond.
I've been reading up on it.
Are these yours?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Never, but I've been practicing.
Not this again.
A water main broke.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Not today.
Did you kill him?
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Why not?
Where are you?
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
You think it's a conspiracy?
Now she tells me.
That's great.  Good for you.
I'm leaning toward no.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Only on the football field.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed.  EX CATCHER.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
Me?  I was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs?  Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
It was.  It was.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
Working.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
Wait --
Ellie?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
I disagree.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum?  We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore.  I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know?  And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right?  So we've been trying variations of pi...
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning I have to go defend a budget to the President and to Congress and you're out here listening to washing machines.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work?  Well, I do care.  Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
If it's attention you want I'd say you've got it.  Just one thing:  Why Vega? Everyone's looked at Vega for years with no results, and now, yesterday, they start broadcasting primes. Why?
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Are you threatening me?
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
We've cracked it.  Lunacharsky found it.
I don't understand.
Ellie... you should know that I'm no longer the President's Science Advisor.
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
NORAD's not tracking any spacecraft in our vector including snoops; shuttle Endeavor's in sleep mode.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
If at some later date the message proves harmless, we can discuss sharing it with the rest of the world, but until then --
That's terrific, but there's one problem:  we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...?  When I was unconscious.  You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even...  This beach.  I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined...  Pensacola.
Small moves, Captain, small moves.
Many others.
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
The infamous, unfashionable bluntness.  You're here so we can do business. I want to make a deal.
I didn't realize I was out.
Oh, maybe not out -- but definitely looking for you coat.  I understand you've had some difficulty locating the -- what are you calling it?  The 'primer' that will make decryption possible...  I've found it.
That's my girl...  Lights.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Sounds like a Russian general.
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
But the work --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
You too.
I'm -- I'm fine.
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone!  The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at...  ... the tape...
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
'My father's house has many mansions.'
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Do you love your parents?
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Why?
In other words.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
It's getting late...
I remember.  You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
Thank you.
Maybe that's okay.
Please --
Don't you understand?  I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I can't hear this now --
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
Meaning...
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
No.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
He's probably a gigolo.
Supposin' you was to backslide on us, Luke? Supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
Yes, Boss.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
She's got him! You hear that?
Says here you done real good in the war: Silver Star, Bronze Star, couple Purple Hearts. Sergeant! Little time in stockades. Come out the same way you went in: Buck Private.
You jes' watch us!
What for?
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
I just always did like truck rides.
Your Lucille? Man, you better put them glasses back on and take a look at yourself.
Boy. You jus' asking to be handled!
Cool Hand Luke.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We got it locked in the sock.
'Atsa sign I got me an affectionate nature.
Oh, that's mah darlin' Luke. Grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
And all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
Do we even get our same bunks back?
Luke, you got to listen to me. All you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
That is one mean lady. Bet her husband spends one day a week shooting milkmen.
Kick a buck.
He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Only kidding!
Open space.  She hasn't been out of this apartment in three years.  I didn't used to think it was real...
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
Without question?  He only scored 40 percent, four out of ten criteria?  Couldn't another expert say he <u>flunked</u> the sexual sadist test?  What curve are you marking on, Doctor?
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
Yes.  I believed him.
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
She don't want it.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
Kurten!  Is he bothering you?  I told that son I'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.
Ah ha.  What did he want?
In jail.
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
Who?
Well, let's thank God you and Inspector Goetz are on the case, then.
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
I know Windex, for God's sake, I clean my own windows...
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
Out.  Where does he go?  Nowhere. What does he do?  Nothing.
Christ, Helen.  The first time, we're ahead of the son of a bitch! I can't leave you like this -- and there's no time.  Knock yourself out.
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
He can get into my computer any time he likes!  This is exactly the kind of thing I didn't want to have happen.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
<u>What</u>?...
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
Michael Johnson.
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
Just horseshit luck.
You came in there with this attitude...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Look at her legs.
Shut up.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
What the hell you need her for?
What does this mean?  Now we got the FBI, my team is expendable? I'm working my ass off, is anybody listening?  Why Ruben, anyway?  He and Nikko don't even get on together...
You got a suspect...
You have no authority to make a deal like that.  That' s for the D.A...
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
She lies all the time.  Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
That's what I don't know.  Why would you lie?  That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
I've been thinking about that, about you and Karen.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
It's about time.
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
Do you find him attractive?
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
I'd like to go back. James...
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I saw the blood. It looks like motor oil.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
You could get your wish at any moment.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
A crude sci-fi concept that floats on the surface and doesn't threaten anybody. I use it to test the resilience of my potential partners in psychopathology.
Well, I don't have hallucinations. Honest.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Go ahead and put the guard back up, Letty. But you need to know what you're dealing with.
There's nothing to tell.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
And the party?
Really?
Do you think I should?
It'll be fine.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Mom, please.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
I answered these questions last night.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
No rounds for another three hours.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
No way.
No, I need some serious household advice.
Out? Are you kidding?     I've got all the fixings here.
Yeah?
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
I couldn't even face that one.
How about a dance?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
It's hard to know where to start.
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
I don't feel like going to work today.
No, it's not like that.
Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
I'm going to the store.
Yes, I suppose so.
Especially this last year.
I just wish we'd done it sooner.
It's, it's really nice, Paul.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
You're going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
Michael.   Yes.
If you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at Grant Park near the statue.
No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
It's me...
Vincent's in the States on business.  That it?
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
And?
Uh, no --
And the other half?
What kind of business?
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Where are you from?
Cops?
What for?
Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go. He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!
I think he's already figured that out.
I think if he told me he was going to steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase" I would remember it.
I'll be Elvis and you--
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
All you are is a professional ass-kisser.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I've got a way with people.
I'm from Belgium.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
It's me.
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
I don't give a shit about your cousin's car. We're here about my car. So, shut your mouth! You think you can do that? You think you can keep your big mouth shut?
Send some flowers. Something nice. Roses or carnations. And one of those get well soon cards.
Everything.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.
There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
What the hell is he talking about?
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
Me?
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
Yeah, I dig him.
Watch this.
Julien, what you're doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. You're projecting your anger onto us.
Glenmorangie.
How are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy does.
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
A car.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Why do you want to teach me?
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
I'm just playing around.
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
Long.
She's one of those.  Your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
You're a sword fighter too?
Fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... Without rules, we wouldn't survive for long.
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Li Mu Bai has made arrangements. He sent him to Wudan Mountain.
You're working together to set me up!  I'm leaving!
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Let's end this here.
Then you have no use for the sword.
My comb!
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
Good.  And how are you?
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
Did you see who posted it?
For her, they might make an exception.  If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
All right.  I'll write you an introduction.  Take it to Wudan. Wait there for news from me.
You're right, but I don't know what to do.  I want to be with you... just like this.  It gives me a sense of peace.
What about you?
That can't be!  Everything has an antithesis!  Why not this?
Shu Lien...
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
I don't know...
Thanks, babe.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
Fun -- look at that guy...
Mister Funboy lives there?
I don't know you...
Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Your pain ends now.
Interested?  Follow the crow.
Fine with me.
Very well, it's your ass.
Only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die. LAO To the contrary...
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
"Our" Crow...?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
On my mother's life.
Okay...
No.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
You implied it.
Thank you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
You don't even know me.
I'm busy.
Yes.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
Yes it does.
Why can't we be together?
Yeah, me neither.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Greg McConnell.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
Okay.
Did you hide the letters?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Does your mother know?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
No.
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Good luck, Sebastian.
Who told you?
Jesus!
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Racist piece of shit.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
It would feel so yummy.
I'm working on it.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What's your plan of attack?
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Have you succeeded in your task?
Cecile.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Who are you spying on?
What's your problem?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
And that's why you're leaving?
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I accept. Now get out.
Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't drugs is it?
Black.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Mrs. Caldwell I think you're misunderstanding something.
Whatever. You are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and I mean never to see my daughter again. Is that understood?!
I'll do that.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Oh... no thank you...
Don't worry about it.
Yes, darling.
But it's already come true.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
I know that.
I know, dear.  I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking.  And especially today — let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
All right, Ollie.  Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
I think I should.  3000W?
Well, you know where it is.
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Yes, daddy.
But wishes don't come true.
I did.  I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
But...
But where do you come from?
For as long as you'll let me.
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
Whenever you want.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
But we don't have any sea weed.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
But, Amy!  Amy...I'm dead.
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
But where has it gone?  Where's all the strength and the quickness?
But I only came to give back the ring.
Who is she?
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?

When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
Go on -- out with you.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
And keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Yeah even then look what happened: Michael Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
So don't look in his eyes.
Maybe he's just shy.
Frida, I don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I still thought it was a purse.
Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
Did you get rid of Mark?
You should have seen it erect.
Hide him.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
I wish I only had your problems.
Oh, a D-Girl. You know... I have a really great idea for a screenplay.
Yes I do have to pee!
Uh huh. So pee.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
Oh, it's nothing.
Sometimes it's frustrating. Like this Gregory Jameson case. We don't even know what killed him. I'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
No. Nope, nothing in it.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
Yeah sort of. Where's Lloyd?
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
Interesting possibility.
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Is that how you feel?
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
NO! Don't come over. Peter... I... I don't want to see you anymore. Ever.
I'm not afraid. Frida! I love you.
Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
She's just so... pathetic.
Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome mess.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
And you think I'm sick?
And he was missing an arm.
The park dude was missing an arm.
Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
Like a vampire or some shit?
What kind of animal?
I <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  I need the file on..  Daniel Paul Schreber M.D.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
I see.  One thingís for sure, heís ambitious. Youíll be a busy man from now on.
Thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  Anyway he isnít with us any longer.  The case is yours.  Go through his files. Take what you need.  By the way, howís your mother?
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Patricia Crenshaw.
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
You wonít regret this, sir.
Who?
Don't know that either.
I'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Then we must call the police.
Tell me about them...
I told you, I can't remember a thing!
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
That's easy.  You...
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
The usual...
It happens.  This is where you'll be sleeping.
Right and don't embellish.
... Alright.
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Well it's a last minute change.
I know.
Just don't call him, Alan!
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Like how?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
What about her.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Oh.  Fine.
What I told him to?
So what do we do?
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
It's alright.  I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Well -- take care.
I'm afraid so.
I don't think so.
Oh.
What?
This is wrong, Alan!
She knows.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Yeah.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Yeah.
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
Certainly.
No thanks.  It's not that far.
You don't change, do you, Bill?
You made their funding disappear!
They asked me to help.
Home.
You have a lot of secrets.
Yes.
Yeah... Bedtime.
We're doing our best, sir.
What about the intro?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Look.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
Well, you managed ta make it here jus' in time fer this case, didn't ya?
...Captain Rhodes is trying to...
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
Tonight?
Gasparilla?
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
Curse?
Farther than you think. You'll get lost. You will. And there's Bees all through the jungle. I ain't lyin' to ya. Religiosos don't lie.
You disappear in here, darlin'. You get a knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer veins. You get lost out here and nobody's gonna notice. Rhodes, he counts on that. It all makes for food in the freezers.
Ain't no place safe.
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Actually I don't
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Will do.
So don't goddam come!  Please.
All I'm saying is we have to be careful. We can't get caught.
Hey, this is great.
Yeah.
The point is she was thinking about me! I've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  Damn it, it's gonna happen!  I feel it.  She's going to be mine!
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
So much the better.
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
All right!  I'm thinking!  "Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments; love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds Or bends with the remover to remove."
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
I'm in.
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
No.
My Word
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
Courtyard?
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
Yawp!
LOUDER!
AHHHHHH!
All right!  Very good!  There's a barbarian in there after all!
Don't stop!
Nothing wrong with research.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
Yes.  But
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
And now he will?
But if he said no before then...
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Er  No.
We have to make it to the third deck...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
I'll kill you!! I'll fucking kill you!! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'm not playin' around here!
Us...I'm talking about us... We're the fish.
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Which question is that?
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
Who asked any?
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
With who?
...there's got to be a way to access out back there...
That's what I do.
Right... You have a boat.
How do you know that?
The quiet...
You should talk...
Yeah...
You ain't giving the orders here!
Shut up, man, just shut the hell up! I gotta think! I gotta think!!
If I don't, I ain't going back to get it...you think we're safe?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
All you're gonna do is get yourself killed...and for what? Some chick?
Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
Like Mamooli's country...
Someone's back there.
I'm looking...
Damn right!
What?
Hey Geraldine, let's eat!
We're all going.
Nick's going?
Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a hot shit... except cold.
You're full of shit!
I'm telling you, they changed it!
They did too!
Nick...?  Jesus, Nick!
What do you think? You think he's been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's been saving your ass, Albert. Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!
Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!
You, Vince! You! You are! You're a crock! You're a walking, talking crock!... I mean, what do you know?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
Everybody love Linda.
You know a guy named Merle?
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Sure.
I don't know.
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Up north.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
And then you...
No. No, no.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Yeah.
From Nam?
I thought you might be praying.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
What?
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Phantom Mary?
You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!
Up ribbon!
I can smell it.
Give it to me.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
I'm not voting for you.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
We have to talk.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
Technothugs.
How do you know?
Well, I'm sure.  You're a cop.  I'm a cop.  Let's do what cops do.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
Wallet, cash, I.D...
How ya feeling?
You treat her nice.
This should make your day.  The guy who testified against you... Dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
Hospital food.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
And you should be with your family.
What's your name?
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
Thank you, Belle --
He lied to me again.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
You think you're so smart, Mrs. Stone. You wanted to be near Jabez. It looked like your big chance tonight, but you're wrong, you can't win him back -- not that way.
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
And serve him right!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
All right, darling.
Don't I? ... Say, that's mighty white of you, Jabez.
Yes, it's the debt and the lien and the mortgage that eats up the farmer!
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
That farmers' association -- we were talking about the other day.
I barely managed to scrape up a bit for you. I thought if I made a kind of part payment --
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
-- of what happens after we die!
All right -- so it's buried with you!
The seventh day of April --
Look here now--
Oh, certainly. I shan't even come to the christening -- it would be tactless and in wretched bad taste.  But I may send a friend of mine -- just for old sake's sake. Yes, I might do that.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
My time isn't up yet.
I'm afraid that's hardly the sort of security I was thinking of --  You see -- there is that promising little fellow, your son ...
Come, come, Mr. Stone, you are a little upset. It's not fair to bargain with you now. -- I'll give you until midnight, Mr. Stone, but not one minute more. Ah, then you'll come with me indeed.
You, Jabez Stone -- you and a lot of poor farmers, hereabouts -- good men of the earth who are in trouble because of you. Or -- am I wrong about those contracts, Mr. Stone?
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
There's no joy in it for me.
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
You're right, Mary.
That's what we said.
Not all of it?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Mary -- how do you feel?
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Thanks, Mary.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Mary -- but look -- it didn't touch an ear of my corn -- we'll have a rich harvest.
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes.  Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
All right, Jabez ...
Sorry, Ma -- but this consar-- this little pig --  He won't let me fix him --
That's right, Ma -- we ain't licked yet. A Stone's never licked till he's dead -- that's what Dad used to say, didn't he, Ma?
Now look here, Ma. I'm not a boy anymore. I want that understood. I don't aim to stay a one-horse farmer the rest of my life. Mary's got to be the kind of wife a -- a big man needs --
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
A man can always change things, Son. That's what makes him different from barnyard critters.
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
And I say she won't! I'll not have the scorn of God on this place -- with the smell of fish in it, polluting up the Sabbath!  And as for you -- let me tell you, young woman...!
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
It's all right, Sheriff.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
I guess we won't.
Land sakes, I don't mind. I never did hold much with Job, even if he is Scripture. He took on too much to suit me. I don't want to malign the man, but he always sounded to me as if he came from Massachusetts. Yes, Mary, you go ahead and read.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
I'll do my best, Mary.
I'd rather see you on the side of the opposition.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
The quick or the dead! You have said it.  May -- the best man win, Mr. Webster!
Why don't you?
I can't be honest with them.
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
Married.
Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance...
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
What are you going to do?
Tell me about it.
What does he want?
It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open!
Go fuck yourself.
I told you...
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
When you're hot, you're hot.
Yes, you're right.  It will be done.
Ramona...no, Pomona, that's it.
I would too. * They lock eyes for a moment, but it's an intense moment that says a lot about how they still feel about each other.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
I'm fine.  You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
Stand by, Powell.  I gotta check something out.
I'm serious.  Hey, this is my wife... Holly Gennero.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who --
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Yes, I would.
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, how'll I get home?
Oh, yeah, I will...
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
Well, you know ... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
What are you talking about?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.  I told him it wasn't a country.  We gotta get outta the country!  To hell with a guy who doesn't know where Wyoming is.  Okay.  Can you imagine what kind of a shape I'm in?
I gotta listen to it if they think...
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
What kind of things, Leon?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
I'll see what they'll do.
Sonny, come on out!
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
I can take care of that.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
I don't fool around with you.
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
You tell me.  Is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I'll get him out.
Everything's all right?  You okay?
It was on the TV.
Did you always call him Junior.
You gonna smoke the cigarette?
What?
But do you mean it?
Yeah ...
Get over there!
Have him walk in backwards.
Oh, Jesus!  Hey.  How about food? I forgot to ask to have food on board.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
What can he do, he's clean...
You can't allow!  I'm running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  Come on.  I'll pay you.  Whatta you want?  Two hundred?  A thousand?
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
No.  This really pissed him off, Sonny.  He says you're dead.  He says he doesn't have a son.
Doing what?
I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not ...
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for ...
How much?
<i>We gotta bring him in.</i>
Fuckin' A! We got a five hour drive back to LA ahead of us. <b> EXT. MACDONALD'S -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Choco is now stripped down to his boxer shorts in the back PARKING LOT of the MacDonald's. Alf is hosing him down. Domino stares at Choco... admiring his body.
Did it hurt?
That bitch called me a bitch.
I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
This is your last chance. Tell us everything you know.
No. Please enlighten me.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
<i>We gotta go to work, Domino.</i>
Claremont said we deliver the First Ladies in Needles. Then we go home. No questions asked.
He said... take his right arm.
Not really.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
So, in other words, you are not down.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Sal, how come you ain't got no brothers up on the wall here?
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
We're still standing.
Gotta go.
Fifty cents.
See ya around.
He's completely innocent.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
Yeah, me too.
I'll do.
Twenty "C" Duracells.
So when is all this ice suppose to melt?
What?
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
You don't know shit about shit.
Mookie?
I work too, but I still make time.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Before I get off work.
I just forgot.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something.  You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
I am a man.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Magic Johnson.
Sounds funny to me.  As much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank Sinatra, too.
Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael Jordan.
I don't like to fight.
He's right.
I love you, my brother.
I like Mookie a lot.
Can you do better?  C'mere.
Yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
Be right there, Pop.  Listen to what I said.
Yeah, you are. He touched you. You're "it" until you touch someone else.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Four colors? Neato!
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
O'clock?
Yeah, but I'm buying.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Me too!
Is that what I think it is?
You're it.
No.
Exactly! A pirate!
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
What?
You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Sure I do. On one condition.
You can't marry my mom.
I bet you want your head scratched.
I bet you want your head scratched.
Sorry, no further questions.
No. Look.
That must be her boyfriend's car.
Well, I'm listening now.
Do you know what this means?
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
That's what Jessica was talking about!
And like she said, do it before the parade.
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
Yeah! No more clicks and whistles! Now she speaks perfect English!
And with that complete loser
Try one in a million!
I wouldn't know. Being that I'm just the teacher and all.
Special Needs class.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Class, please study on your own. There seems to be a family emergency because there's no other reason why my father would interrupt me WHILE I'M WORKING!
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
No.
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Oh, this is fantastic. So all we have to do is kill this Moffit guy and we get all the money!
Monkey, this is too exciting! I can't believe our dream is coming true.
Okay, I'll take care of Jessica.
Yes. So as soon as Zimmer shows up, we'll get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
This band sounds terrible.
No... no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
Nothing.
We felt his presence.
Sire!
If you'd fought one whit below your abilities I'd have scratched you a good one.
Are you trained in the ways of the desert?
I will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe.  Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.
They want me to take the Water of Life... the Truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these Fremen.  I will try to pass within.
Paul... please, Paul... listen to the Reverend Mother and do what she tells you.
Where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
Always?
To protect their territory. Vibrations attract them. -- PAUL  I've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... He's strong... a person born to command... He's hiding many things.  Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
Pain.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
What is it?
Did they try and fail?
SILENCE!
Those sounds could be imitated.
Uh, Greetings.  I am the Count...
YES!  My father ran a mortuary -- it's an old habit!
Ha!
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
I didn't feel well...
Goulash.
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
So how'd we do?
Mmph?  Where am I?
"Dear, you're lovely."  "Strap her to the table."
Yeah, I did.
This'll look a lot better.  We have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
Huh?
Norma.  She changed her mind.  She doesn't wanna marry me.  Can you put down the gun?
Don't you have any savings?
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Soon, Bela... Soon.
Mexico!  And guess what I'm going to do there?!
Eddie, we're in show biz!  It's all about razzle-dazzle.  Appearances. If you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
The ghost can be barefoot.  <u>Give</u> <u>me your shoes</u>!
Ed, it was only one review.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
It takes me comfortable.
I'm sorry!  What did you want me to say?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Did you really mean those things you said..?
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Hruphh...?
Raising money is tough.
I like to think so.
Don't worry.  We're almost there.
Yes?
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
So you're not a fruit?
Good.  And one more thing.  I think your "Written, Directed, and Starring Ed Wood" credit is a bad idea.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh.  My condolences.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
They're very nice.  Let me get my coat.
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Nah, 'cause I had my comic books. And I read pulp magazines.  And I listened to the radio dramas...
Huh?!
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
No, he would've loved it!  Bela's returned from the grave -- like Dracula.  CUE VAMPIRA!
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Ed Wood!  You came to my party.  I directed "Bride Of The Atom"!
What if I'm vomiting?
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
Who?
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder.
What?
You know it.
Cool.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Great line.
Ed --
This guy.
I'm Dr. Geller. Your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
Really? They were..
Who?
Tell me.
When? Today?
So does Grandma. So does Shaquille O'Neal. You told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
What do you think. I mean about... him. Should I just... have nothing to do with him? I mean...
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Hank! He said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. So I went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... I felt so sorry for him --
Do you think it's been easy for me? It's been years. Al can't have sex.
Ma...
And how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
Shari, Ray feels --
No, I mean...
You batted or you bunted?
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
It's quite an honor. Will you come with me?
Why?
He could give me some oxygen.
... yeah, then, but...
Really? 
Where?
Come on.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
You're in show business?
What?
Why do you do that?
What?
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
Oh, don't bullshit a bullshitter. If you're happy like this you're an idiot, and you're not an idiot.  Hi.
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too.
Ray, come an--
It could be, if you fixed it up. How did you... ? I mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
Oh, man! So...
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
You know, Tracy... I don't know how to say this, but...
Well, Sherry's great.  But she can be a little much sometimes.
Dick... Dick,..
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
I know.
You bet.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
That said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  We'll begin with president.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Plenty of pep, too.
Uh-huh.
Yes?
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
Yeah... whatever.  All I know is she's a troublemaker.  She's on my list.
Nowhere.  I don't have class until second period.
Door was open.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
I also like bananas.
Why don't you guys go sit down, okay? I'll catch up in a minute? I want to talk to Mr. M. about some important stuff.
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
Thanks!
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
So Mr. M. calls me in and tells me --
What'd I do?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
You wanna get me a fuckin' snitch jacket?
Yeah, plain scotch.
Are you sorry she's dead?
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
Yes.  But do you know?
Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl?
Tell me about Patchett.
It's Lynn.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
And for good reason judging from what I know of your background.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Maybe.  I don't know.
No!  Please leave!
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
Lynn.
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
<u>Stensland and Buzz Meeks</u>.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus.
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
Dudley's guys.
With a wrecking ball.  You want to help me swing it?
Which one are you and which one am I?
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
Nothing.
Someone must've pulled the records.
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
Some ferstunkener is moving in and we don't know who?!  Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper!
Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Something's wrong.  I feel it inside.  Doesn't that sound crazy?
Anonymous.  Probably nothing.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
For the last time.  I may suborn women into illicit activities, but they're handsomely compensated, I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect.
Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores?
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Jack!  It's Christmas!
No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled
You tight with the D.A., trash?
Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke.
And Reynolds?
Around.
Jackie, all I know is what you know.  The man is very rich.  And he's invested in freeway construction so he's gonna get a lot richer.  But that's it. Patchett's what I like to call 'Twilight.'  He ain't queer, he ain't Red, he can't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo.
A bootleg...
Please hold, Sergeant...
I'm telling you, I--
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Who are you calling?!
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Really?
Wait.
Yeah.
I clipped this from your wheel well just before they towed your car away.
I don't know what that means.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
They're spooks.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
I called my wife!
I didn't use my name.
I told you no calls.
I was a traffic analyst.
How'd you get around the tap orders?
Jesus.
Who?
You sure?
That wasn't so hard.
We're not gonna hurt you.
We're honest people and we need your help. I'll give you two- hundred dollars if you--
Same thing?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
Oh my God.
Yes. I have her permission.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
I don't know anything about this. Well, I mean, I know a <u>little</u> about--from a certain perspective. My point is, I don't want to do anything foolish.
Why?
A police report.
Because I don't know.
No.
Anything at all?
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Sorry.
He's got his priorities?
I know.
It's not a real picture, Stacy, it's been doctored-up.
Do you know what I'm looking at Robert?
Stacy--
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
I was in a car chase and a small explosion. Now listen to me: The NSA is behind this. They think that guy I told you about, Daniel Zavitz, they think Zavitz gave me a tape or computer chip of some kind that could be damaging to them. So they're doing all these things <u>electronically</u>. The bank records, the surveillance. They're the ones who broke into the house. Now I know there's no reason to believe me. But I love you. And I love our son. So just believe me anyway.  Please.
That was for Christmas.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
A friend of mine. I don't know his real name. He's dead now.
My suitcase is gone.
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
Oh.
Not that much.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
You got a minute?
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
Otherwise you may have to what?
Otherwise you may have to what?
We'd rather not--
I have to go lingerie shopping.
Gimme a week and four guys from litigation and I'll have the Post pleading with us not to sue for libel.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
I don't under--
My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
Why?
Hi, dad.
Men don't win fights with women, son, I'll tell you about that sometime, too. In the meantime, I've got a question for you, and it's incredibly important that you tell me the truth. Under no circumstances will I be angry with you. This is a total Get-Out-Of- Jail-Free card. Ready?
No.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
Table 122?
Yes.
Jesus.
I don't know. I mean--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
Yeah?
Turn yourself in.
Bobby--
Tell me about it.
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Then what's your goddam opinion?
There was a transfer.
He had help.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
If he's with Lyle it means he's got resources.
Resources, that's a good point. He's got resources. All we've got is a <i>six-hundred billion dollar</i> <i>organization!</i> Now god<u>dammit</u>, Hicks, you find 'em. You find 'em and you end it now!
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
No.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Hello!  Good morning.
You felt obliged to.
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
I'd like you to have them.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Water?  Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  Come on, come on!  There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Don't.
You sew very badly.
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
This is empty, just coming!
No, no, it's Hungarian.  My daijka sang it to me.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
It's a long song - Szerelem means love…and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool.  For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
You bastard, I was believing you!
You will.  You will.
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
A surprise, he said.
I know.
You too.  Good luck!
I see.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
No.
I keep explaining.  You've got the wrong man.  My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini.  Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
I slept with the girl.  I've got a wife in Tripoli.  A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Don't cut me.
You were in Africa?
I'd like to stay.  That's the long and short of it.  I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah.  I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
I don't know what that means.
I think that's called looting.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
All over?  I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  Are you leaving us?  Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
I don't know.  Paper.  Is it? Paper?  I don't remember.
What did you say?
Lady H said she thought you might be -
Sweetheart, you know we can't go home, there might be a war.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Apprentices.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
Yes.  Dropping off.
Are you crazy?
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Just go off.  I'll be quite all right.
Why?  Is he staying?
I don't think it's indifference.
No!
The Germans were here.  The Germans were all over this area.  They left mines everywhere.  Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
I don't think so.
It's what I've learned.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
We can do that when we're very, very old.
I'm afraid so, sir. Kip hurries to his tent.  Hana follows him.
Or my wife's.
Through a window.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
We're getting close.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Where are you at least?
Are you...okay?
Excuse me?
No. Why would I be?
You what--?
Got it.
I never carry...baggage.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
True enough.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
Our equipment has arrived.
Yes you did.
A dozen times.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Terrified. Still am.
You're not on the beat.
What?
You don't know the half of it.
Where the money is.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Can't be too careful.
Surgically attached.
It was wrong to deceive you.
That's because you grew up rich.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
No, you can't.
But--
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
You are a miracle worker.
This is big enough.
This better be worth 1t.
You look like George Washington.
Remind me why.
We're supposed to.
You damn well thought wrong.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
You're giving them to me?
Don't use language with me --
250,000 is all I'm authorized to offer.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
It's those files you asked for.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
Which one?
What's your point?
You're a lawyer?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
They did?
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Five million dollars?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Where's Anna?
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Good.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
So what made you think it was?
What medical records?
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
It's not about working hard --
You think there's more?
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
What do you mean?
Me too.  That's why I like it.  It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
Whoa.  No shit.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Not in my world.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
And if you had to guess ...
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Why not?
Erin --
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
And ...?
Ross.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
There's more than one kind?
Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Highly toxic, highly carcinogenic.  Bad, bad stuff.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
When?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
Now, don't be like that.  Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
Ten?
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
How would you know?
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
What do you want, a joke?
Lock the door.
What's that?
Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
That's okay.  I understand.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Uh-huh?
Wow, that's soon --
Who's Baxter?
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Yes, My Lord.  We'll find them.
He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
What happened?
Oh, a Jedi Master.  Different altogether.  Yoda you seek, Yoda.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Our destruction?  Who?
Wait.  I'll send a patrol with you.
Not collapsing, honey.  It's closing!  This is no cave ...
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Han, we need you here.
Yes.
What was it?
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
I don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
Fine with me.  But I'm afraid you'll have to let go.
There's nothing dull about a man I can depend on to be civilized.
Outside, in the cave.
Strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
The entrance is collapsing!
No lightspeed?
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
You look great.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Don't worry.  You haven't seen the last of us.
No hard feelings?
I'll bet.
You're part of the mining guild then?
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
I didn't say anything?
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
You are reckless!
Yes, but by what standard, ask I?  Forget your old measures. Unlearn, heh, unlearn.
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Only what you take with you.
My mind fills with so many images.
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
And I too.
No!
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
Make ready to land General Veers' assault troops on the surface. Then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. You're in command now, Admiral Piett.
Believe what?
I like you.
C'mon, Snake - it's L.A. Everything's phony, you know that.
He jumped. Down there.  He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
Don't lie to me.
If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
That's the deal.
Tell the President to adopt. I think I'll like L.A.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
Locked.
So where's Plissken?
Does he know how to activate it?
So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
No screamin' shit.
The freeway.
It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Who?
Who ain't?
...Perceval!
Move aside!
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
Don't recognize him. You were trapped by Morgana's sorcery.
...Gawain and Perceval, Bors and Bohort, Caradoc and Ector, and all the others--lost to me. Only the echo of their voices remains in this empty hall. All I have left is the memory of their fellowship. Echoes and memories. I am a ghost of the King that once was...  ...Mordred is real, alive, my own flesh and blood. I will see him, I must.
Lancelot?... It is Lancelot!
'Help me, Help me.' Help me get up.
Well there. You don't need me half as much as you think you do. You already know what must not happen.
Thank you.
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
Quiet, or I'll sew up your mouth too.
And if he cannot be found, no other knight will champion me, though you beseeched each and every one of them. Why be king if there is no one you can call loyal subject but an eager boy?
You and the land are one. Drink from the chalice. You will be reborn and the land with you.
Why?
You.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
I will run.
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
No, he's working on another book.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Storage.
It's serious?
Good morning Karl. Oh Karl, we've got rats in the attic you better get some traps.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
The temperal lobe is very common. Could last for days, even weeks. It isn't rare to find destructive or even criminal behaviour.
I think it's time we started looking for a psychiatrist.
Pretty close?
If he came to me for spritual help, I'd say no.
Not a psychiatrist! She needs a priest! She's already seen every fucking psychiatrist in the world and they sent me to you, now you're gonna send me back to them! Jesus Christ, won't somebody help her!
What else?
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Father?
You know, I make the questions and he does the answers.
He's nice.
I don't know
What?
I don't know, I just thought.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
Okay.
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Listen, I don't need any encouragement, but my idea of heaven is a solid white night club, with me as the head liner, for all eternity and they love me.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Bon Jour.
Until she rots and lie stinking in the earth.
Holy water.
Merrin! Merrin!
How's your leg?
No.
Momma, I'm all right, I'm fine, really I am.
Why?
The Lord be with you.
... upon this your servant, Regan Teresa MacNeil.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
Yeah, I hate to go alone. You know, I like to talk film; discuss the critique. D'you wanna see a film with me? I got passes to The Crest. It's Othello.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Fuck him Karras!!! Fuck him!!!
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
If I ask him to tell me, will you let him answer?
It's all there.  Both nights.
Twelve years.
Right, twelve years.  Couple times a month.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Honey ...
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
No.
Recognize these two characters?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
Yamaha white.  Nice.
No thanks.
You gotta go.
Your older brother.
Yeah.  Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
No.
That how you see it?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
I'll take my chances.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Not true.  Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Okay.
Right.  I love you, Frank.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Maybe so.  You ever go back there?  Where it happened.
Better give her pneumonia.
What channels it on?
Seventy-one
That's right.  I wasn't there.  I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
What're you doing?
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
This'll kill 'em.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Yeah.  Larry Shelton.  Blackie.  Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
The flu.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Big feet.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
I was gonna split it with you guys.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Yeah.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Yes, well, they are.
Will I see you again?
All right.  Hold on.
Is that the way it is?
He mentioned you had a girl for a while.  A singer.
I suppose.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
Nothing personal --
It's okay.  Last one.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
What's that supposed to mean?
You were good.
Friend.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Coffee?
Yeah... No.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
No.
Why not?
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
I'm not much for sweets.
You mean if I get sick?
My place.
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
Like ...
Something good?
How come?
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
Jon, what is it?
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
Call Lazarro.  Castor just came out of his coma.
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Let's not confuse things anymore.  I'm Archer. You're Castor.  But if you need proof --
So's a noose.  Now keep your mouth SHUT.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
Janie?
Get rid of them.
Business first.  I went into the "Warrants" system and erased your records.  You're clean.  In fact, you're now on the informant payroll.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Jon, you're starting to remind me -- of me.  Congratulations.
You always say that -- then you leave.
You're a ray of sunshine, Jack.
Ooh, my suits are ready...
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  I almost married her...
You?  Married?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody’s here.
Adelle?
You were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? Your trip to Aspen? They’re all panicked here...
I can see that, Alan.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Big Ed’s?  Big Ed’s Tires?  Why...?
Don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It’s your birthday? Today?  What’s your name?  Where were you born?
We bowl together. We’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
Damn, you are the real thing...
What the hell is happening to me?!
Why not?
C’mon, Jack...
What're you talkin' about?
C’mon, as soon as I put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
You’re a nurse?
Maybe you’re not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
No, she’s not.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
...my feet are hurtin’...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
Excuse me?
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Sure.  I really like Annie.
You had a heart attack?
If you want to look at it that way...
That’s my piece.  I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
What? You make me hot...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
And now...?
I’ll just full yours up to the top.  Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
Way out...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
For the week?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
To Paris. Paris, France.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Last night was great...
Jersey?  You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
Merry Christmas...
I wouldn't know anything about that.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Am <u>I</u> okay?!  You wanna explain that?!
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Put your tiny little mind at ease.
Don't you wander off, boy.
Give me a mirror...
Baby, you're scaring me.
Where do you <u>think</u>?  With <u>Sue</u>.
What do you mean "complete"?
What he's trying to say is: every team needs a mascot...
A higher calling like getting girls and making money?
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Okay, "mom."
As soon as you stop <u>acting</u> like one. Come on, you're <u>smarter</u> than this. You think those people out there <u>care</u> about you?  You're just a <u>fad</u> to them.
Reed's <u>always</u> right.  Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Reed's disaster.  You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
We need to get past them.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
Better than your <u>life</u>.  Victor's not the one who has to get into that thing.  <u>We</u> are.
<u>I'm</u> not the only one in there.  I got you, Vic, Ben, Johnny, all rattling around in there.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps.  And this is the biggest step yet.  If it helps, think of this as a <u>promotion</u>.  A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Skeptical...?
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
Brain injury.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Come along, they'll be operating shortly.  See you later, Mike.
Trip? Where to?
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
A long time, with one man.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
A great deal more than that, I believe...
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
Let's hope... So far, somebody's tried to sabotage this mission twice.
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
Two in a row?
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Just what it is. Antibodies, destroying Bacteria -- or any other foreign invader that threatens the System.
Nothing has changed as far as <my> authority goes! He is <not> going to operate! Not in the little time we have left! There's no chance of success! It's sheer suicide for all of us!
Nothing you could see with the naked eye. But there's a microscopic radio-active particle inside.
I'll do what I can.
The Wall's transparent...
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Unghh... oh, geez...
Can I see your license and registration please?
Whoa, Daddy.
Okay, it's - see, it's not me payin' the ransom. The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy - her dad, he's real well off. Now, I'm in a bit of trouble -
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
Three people. In Brainerd.
We need more -
Yah, okay, but, uh -
You're sittin' here, you're talkin' in circles! You're talkin' like we didn't go over this already!
Okay, I'm not sayin' I didn't -
End a April.
Any others?
Where'd you get him that parka?
Chaska.
In what way?
Yah.
Uh-huh.
Yah.
You wouldn't have an extra ticket there?
Yah.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
We're gonna get Mom back for ya, but we gotta play ball. Ya know, that's the deal. Now if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia, you just say that Mom is in Florida with Pearl and Marty...
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Yah, but -
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Well, but see, I don't have 'em in front a me - why don't I just fax you over a copy -
Yah, no problem, I'll just fax that over to ya, then.
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
Good day, sir.
...Yah.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Yeah, okay. Well, siddown then.  I'm Carl Showalter and this is my associate Gaear Grimsrud.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
Twice.
Yah.
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
Ah, dammit!
The heck d'ya mean?
Well, that's okay, I just -
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Yah?
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
No way.
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
Yah, well, I, uh... it's not that it didn't work out - Linda passed away. She, uh...
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Yah.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Uh-huh.
Yah, ya think?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Yah.
Oh, my.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Yeah, both of us.
Some of it, yes.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
No, I wasn't aware...
It means it was homemade.
Practicing what?
Anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
You can't have the whole brain!
Look, this is a bad time...
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Good.
There?
It was the smart move on her part.
Marla, no, wait...
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Well... let me see... here's the thing...
Nine time out of ten, it's an electric razor.  But, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  It's airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  We use the indefinite aricle: "A dildo."  Never "Your dildo."
Now, find your power animal.
You're a tourist.  I saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
Well, uh... great.
We're on our third pitcher of beer. Just ask me.
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
What's that?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
What car?
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Yeah, I'm sure.
Don't mention me.
I was going to my cave to find my power animal.
It isn't... ?
Fucking sweet.
Tell him!
You know what I mean.
I want to know --
I don't think that's true.
What?
... is over.
Why did you do that?
You took me to the house.
Um, well... technically, no.
...your sentences!  They're our sentences.  Get your mind around that.
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Fuck you.
Do we have to do everything ourselves?!
Why are you doing this?!
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Not my mouth.  Our mouth.
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
Ain't that something?
Why?
Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
Do you want to deliver this baby?
There's going to be a pile up.  Logs. Bodies everywhere.  I saw it happen. It happened.
The log truck...and everybody I guess. Everyone was driving like a maniac. And somehow I knew something horrible was going to happen, even before it did.
Hold on.
No, I'm good.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
I know, Dad.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
I'm... really sorry.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Easy, Billy, just open it.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
You're the fuckin' devil.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
No... I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Terry's name should be on this wall.
They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
That's what I'm here for.
Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
There are no worse places.
I had it cupped.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
What's that?
Powerful warrior.
Guard barracks.  Take some shots.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Forget it.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Nguyen is good boy.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
How you going to get there?  You can't trust the spooks to pull you out.  They'll use you up and throw you away.
Don't look so disappointed.  It should be hairy enough... even for you.
What?
He... took it.
Not my people.
Can you walk?
Mind if I sit down?
I say we tape him to a chair.
No, thank you.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
Meeting ... people.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
I was attacked.
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
The moron?
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
You're kidding!  What did he say?
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
Fine.
Huh-huh.
Which ones?
All of them... Which means <u>you</u> have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God...  ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him.  He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
You're out numbered son.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
You're married.
Yeah, 'cause she's so "twinky"...
Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
A wig?
Look at these assholes! What the hell are they doing?!
It's ridiculous! I'm sitting here, listening to some asshole cracker compare his life to mine!
I hope that's all you gotta say, El, 'cause I'm about as tired of your mouth as I am workin' this stinkin' hole!
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
No.
Now, now.
Out where?
I love it.
Who said I was depressed?
Five'll do it.
What does that mean? You don't have any tomatoes?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Would you tell her Bobby's here?
That's good.
Don't, then.
No.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Who's Van Oost?
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Don't tell me about this...
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
Sort of.
I don't know where she is!
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
But what about me?
I guess you fell in the water.
That's what I mean...
It's a Borzoi.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
A dispose-all, what's that but more crap? I've never seen such crap. Oofh, I don't know how people get up in the morning.
Bullshit! Truck drivers know the best eating places on the road.
Don't call me "honey," mack.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
And they picked up! I mean, it wouldn't be filthy, with Coke bottles and whiskey, and those signs everywhere...
Right, steam. A car you could ride around in and not cause a stink. But do you know, they will not even let us have it. Can you believe it? Why?! Man! He likes to create a stink. I wrote them a note once, and told them to clean it... I mean, don't you see that? It's just filthy! I mean, I've seen filth you wouldn't believe! Oofh, what a stink! I don't even want to talk about it...
Well, she was.
Fine.
What?
Hurry up, you're wastin' my time, what the fuck.
Is it true?
I guess he's outside someplace I don't like takin' him down to certain places.
How you treat them?
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
Eddie from Compost?
No, Baruch.
You know, Eddie's cousin.
For real?
A bad attitude.
You said before, that he got boxes?
I think he's 18 or 17.
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Your friend must be misinformed.
Probably.  One of the many.
Wha'?
You gotta girLfrLend?
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
Wonder who his supplier is.
I have no idea.
Nineteen.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
What'll it be Fletch?
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
One. B-a-b-a-r.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
You're in the Records Room.
Well, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought the dead man was my brother.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
'...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.'
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Check.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
Yeah. Maybe.
Who?
Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange.
So why pick me?
Sure, all drifters do.
Me neither. See what we've got on a guy named Alan Stanwyk, okay? I need it right away.
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
His bride. Cute as a button.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
You are a rich woman.
See what I mean?
Can I borrow your towel for a minute?
I ordered lunch.
You ordered it here?
Yes.
I saved his life during the war.
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Why'd you let me in?
I'll cover it. You have any other surprises?
No.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Sierra del fuego.
Far out.  Larry? It's Fletch.  Well, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but... any port in a storm.  Oh, tell Frank I need a couple of months. The fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.
Who are you?
She moved out?
How gray?
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures.
What about finding the source?
I have some ideas.
Get out of here.
You'll have it.
Print this Frank.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
But I ain't got you...
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Excuse me?
Actually, you may take it all now.
Who?
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Zuzu Petals!  Did she have it?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Could somebody tell me what's going on?  <u>Like slo-owly</u>...
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Yeah, Colleen mentioned it.  What do they make?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
What a perv...
People still watch that?
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
I won't ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  Shall we?
Well what is it?  I'm not Kreskin.
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
You need it.
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
<u>I'm.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.  In</u>. <u>The.  Wide.  World</u>.
Anyway you want it, asshole.
Ah, I didn't say seven <u>P</u>.M., now did I?
Only on a first name basis.
Hey, the poet...
It is to us!  It's computerised.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
I don't remember any Arbor Day cards from Mr. Rock 'n' Roll Detective.
What?
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
Goodbye.
... Salvatore?...
Yes --
You must take me for an imbecile. Why do you think I asked you to meet me in Washington?  I haven't spent five minutes in New York City without the company of a gendarme.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Si tu veux.
Pour moi?
Not any woman, Marie.  Just one.
Mmm.
Gimme a break, Mr. Russo.  I'm in show business.
You want some eggs.
Why not?
Where the hell is it?
Strike out, eh?
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Drink this.
The other guy's a frog too.  Checked in at the Edison.  Had a hooker sent up.
Pass.
The river at this point is the most dangerous on the East Coast.  Years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
For garbage?
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Yeah.
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
No, I think he's up in interrogation.
I'll go find Hayes.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
I'm alright, Gibby.
You alright?
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
Sure.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
I love you more.
Wish you weren't.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I know.  He loves that thing.
So am I.
Hello, Frank.
Do you know where I found this?
Satch, would you listen to me here.  Just you and me.  Can I talk to you here, alone?
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
Get him home safe.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Wait...
Name's John.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What?
This afternoon?
Johnny...?
No wait, don't go!
She just died, your mother just died?
I don't know...  What about the other women?
They'll question her.  Whatever they tell her could change what happens.  No, I want you to follow her.  See if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I'm betting somebody's gonna walk outta that bar with her.  When they do, you call the cops.
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
Wow.
H-hi.
Yeah, I think so...
Don't worry, Chief.  I'm not gonna let anything happen to her...no matter what.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
No.  I gotta tell him the address, so he doesn't go in.
How'd you know my name, mister?
Whoa, I just...I just...
And I'm tired of the I'm sorrys.  I don't need 'em.  What I need is a partner I can count on.  I care about you.  Not cause of me and your old man.  Not cause of your mom. But because of you.
I'm just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that Daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
Yeah.  Sure.
Sounds good.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
I beg your pardon, I'm not an asshole.  I'm an actor.
Would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Not now.  I'm cold.
Barely.
What?
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
I don't know.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
What?
Are you all right, Shelly?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
In that little thing?
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
I never said you were "nothing".
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
I wish it was.
Whaddya mean?
See any paint?...  ...Sorry, guys, I did in Mr. Commando.  Survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
I already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...Megan, Jason is out there.  He has to be stopped.  I'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  He'll keep killing until...
No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Nancy.
I found it outside.
But what I get scared again?
You gotta be kidding!
Yeah, we're here.
There's no time for this bullshit...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
I've seen it.
Skin stretcher was human.
Twenty.
Look, I don't want your money!
Why don't you blow me, Chief.  After your girlfriend gets through.
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Gotta go.  See you guys later.
About Jessica.
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
I mean really never.
I'm sorry to hear that.  A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Jason...Voorhees?
What are you going to do?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
Where is she?
I'm staying.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
She didn't push me into coming.
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
The window...
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
That's where I peed.
Elliot?
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
We must abandon.
Do not inhale.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
What was it like?
He'll kill it. He'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. What happens to your apartment on the East River? Your house in Connecticut, where you watch things grow.
What?
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
How do you Eknow.
Paisley Porter.
Let's work on it.
Does it feel comfortable?
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
The Red Sox
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
Don't talk like that. How prominent? What are you implying?
Don't be so steely-eyed. It's that course you're taking in criminology.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
What do we want?
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
Yes.
An artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
Alma Wetzel.
I respect a kid who does his homework in a taxi. But let's put a lid on the questions.
What did it say?
Right here. At the door.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
I could have grown up happy. A Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
Matthew's my grandson.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Now that's a complicated subject.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
It's a test all right. They're bringing in Stanley.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
hat was this morning.
Postpone. We have every right.
Get the hell out of here. I don't want you bringing our food. Send a real waiter.
But I know you, don't I? I seen you on a poster in the theater district. I'll think of your name in just a --
Yes.
I know it sounds easy. But something happens between the time I hear the line and the time I'm suppose to Jrepeat it.
Endearing.
The fact is, I have to get going.
He's a very sweet man.
There's a certain kind of wounded young man who uses his oddness to get laid. Is that our Steven?
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Yes -- I can't talk like this.
Eleven.
I am. But I'm not so egotistical as to think He plans His day around my dilemmas.
Going nearer to God!
A -- a week.
I hope not.
I would rather march.
That was England.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
The fools!  Sorry...
If you did this, no one could control it. No one.
It's for the best.
Who are you trying to convince?
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not...  ...universally loved.  He was leading the cut-backs in the program.  You're looking at a room full of motives.
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
This is a murder investigation.  The public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
He's not here.  It's a blind alley.
We don't have the manpower.
Often.
Thank you, no.
You have more in common than you know.
God, you're serious, aren't you?
You wish.
In a corridor.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
If I were you I'd worry about myself.  Haven't you forgotten something?
She doesn't <i>have</i> to know.  She doesn't <i>want</i> to know.
I'm travelling too.
We would like Vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
That's the hair color in his profile?
They said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  You think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  Maybe they'd be <i>more</i> human.  From where I sit the world could stand a little improving.
I was at home.
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Yes...<i>yes</i>...
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I've been doing my homework.
Just like old times?
I hope so. I am not looking forward to another stretch.
Fatter... some things never change.
After four years and now the question comes up.
It's all right.
Better than I remembered.
Yeah... I know.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
... and live happily ever after.
So what. I've got to give him his money. That was our end of the deal.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
You sent me to him.
What the hell do you want? Mary Tyler Moore?
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
I wouldn't worry Doc. I can always get you out... I'll screw every prison official in Texas if I have to.
You'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, Doc?  If I was caught, wouldn't you?
El Paso.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
No more about Beynon.
You want to try with me?
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Who was it?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
I guess we are.
I never have any luck.
By the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
What about you?
Where we go in1?
Two years.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
I got a nurse in mind.
When did you find out?
A couple of weeks back.
Oh ay?
Was the steering faulty?
How'd it happen, then?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
Never mind.
Why?
Jack...
Good evening.
I can't Jack. How can I?
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Nicer than most.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Now you're asking.
Tell me about the girl.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Then he must have pulled her.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Nice of you to come.
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
I left last year.
That must be interesting.
What?
At the Half Moon.
That's what I was wondering.
Oh yes? How?
Definitely.
No, you won't.
What am I supposed to do?  I don't know where they've taken him. Do you?
Do you want breakfast?
No chance of that.
Not much.
Oh, that's nice.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Scotch, please.
Yep.
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
That's what you pay to find out. Right, Jack?
That's right, Harry.
Ha.
No.
...Polacks...
...they hold on to their money...
You get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "Patel?"
Mmm...
Well, I think I had one once.
And now...
You get a bad month, all of a...
That's right?
That's right?
Eh?
And so they kill the goose.  I, I, I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...cower in his boots...
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What act?
That's right...
You don't ax your sales force.
They have...
Look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  No.  You're absolutely right, and I want to tell you something.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Yes...?
What?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
No, we're just...
However they are, that's the deal. A buck a throw.  Five thousand dollars.  Split it half and half.
He'd give me a job.
What?
What?  What?  The leads.
You...
I didn't ask to be.
Why are you doing this to me, Dave. Why are you talking this way to me? I don't understand.  Why are you doing this at all...?
In the abstract...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
Were the leads insured?
What?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Where was I?
Thieves.
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
I didn't rob...
Will you get out of here.  Will you get out of here.  Will you.  I'm trying to run an office here.  Will you go to lunch?  Go to lunch. Will you go to lunch? 
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
You have a problem?
I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you please, I'll be back in.  I'll be back in a while...I told you, check with Mr. Williamson.
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
...I, if you'd listen to me. Please.  I closed the cocksucker. His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know he was married...he, the judge invalidated the...
...no...
Murray said...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
I will close.  John, John, ten percent.  I can get hot.  You know that...
Good.  Now we're talking.
Can't do it.
The deal still stands, our other thing.
What does that fucking mean?
Yes, I am.
What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday.  Why you don't belong in this business.
Why I don't...
You're so full of shit.
You robbed the office.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Forget it.  Frame it.  It's worthless.
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Last night, this morning.
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Yes.
Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on the one...  Well, let's scoot...
Ricky...
What do I...?
My wife...
Why did she do that, Jim?
To change our minds.
Three business days.  They mean three business days.
But I'm not counting it.  Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So it would have elapsed.
What was the earliest it could have been cashed?
I told you.
You tell me again.
She wants her money back.
We're going to speak to her.
No, Jim.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You going to turn State's?
Your farewell to the troops?
You closed him yesterday.
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva handed him a million dollars, told him "sign the deal," he wouldn't sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You know your business, I know mine. Your business is being an asshole, and I find out whose fucking cousin you are, I'm going to go to him and figure out a way to have your ass... fuck you--I'll wait for the new leads.
Did you like your party?
I can't.
To do business.
Yes, thank you.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Connie.
Tom is right.
Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman...
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
C'mon, I see what I can do.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
That's what I'm here for.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
What do you want me to do?
To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move.
Taken care of me.  Mike, you're my kid brother, and you take care of my.  Did you ever think of that. Ever once?  Send Fredo off to do this, send Fredo to take care of that... take care of some little unimportant night club here, and there; pick somebody up at the airport.  Mike, I'm your older brother; I was stepped over!
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad.
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Why didn't someone tell me!
No, I have confidence in their loyalty... but this is life and death, and Tom, you are my brother.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
I want it met.
Good.  Then you're staying.
Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
Is he related to the witness?
The committee is adjourned until further notice.
Yes, Michael.
Where?
I represent the interests of the Corleone family.  We make the invitation to you to tie up your affairs and be out of the hotel by Monday morning.
However I can help you...
Technically, they are still under the Clemenza wing of the Corleone Family, now run by Frankie Pentangeli.  After Clemenza died, the Rosatos wanted territory of their own.  Pentangeli refused, and came to me, asking for permission to eliminate them.  I, of course, knew of their relationship with you, and in gratitude for your help with the Tropicana matter, turned him down.  Pentangeli was furious, and paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars to have me killed. I was lucky and he was stupid. I'll visit him soon.  The important thing is that nothing jeopardize our plans, yours and mine.  This thing of ours, that we will build.
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
Except the President of the United States.
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.
No.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Says who?
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys.
I know.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I trust these men with my life. They are my right arms; I cannot insult them by sending them away.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
The same assurance we got from you.
What if I say shove it?
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
We got friends in the commission.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
What's to be jealous of?
You mean us?
What're you talking about?
You will not hurt him?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
A man who is not married has nothing.  He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Well...no, not really --
You and he are not doing things?
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Huh?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
That's exactly what I intend to do.
This David's a friend?
Did anyone laugh?
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Why?  Was it supposed to be funny?
I don't like to talk about that.
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges.
No, I -- you're a homosexual.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
You know how it is.  You have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
I'd like to sit for you again.  But only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  Okay?
Everybody has stories to tell.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're talking through your hat now.
I didn't --
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink?
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
Run for what?
Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Why not?  Give us something to do while we wait.
Never gave it much thought.
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
I see.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
You are much too human.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
You told me to get you up, asshole.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
I'm fine, Jimmy.  I can only stay a few minutes.
Yes?
Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Quite.
Righto.  Let me see.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't go away.
Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Stopped by to see Otto. Say hello.
It's the same way with cars. Different cars. Different tunes. You can't steal a Maserati listening to Sinatra. You gotta get urgent. You gotta get Sonny Rollins or Led Zeppelin IV, on that shit. But never, never-ever take no Allman Brothers into a Lincoln Town Car. Could lead to disaster. Got it... ?
That's an after-market alarm. Can't just cut her wires ...
It's all microchips and shit ...
Donny-nothin'!
It's arright ...
one minute -- !
You, too, Ma...
You getting my checks ... ?
Of course ...
We'll take it.
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Yeah ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
"About what?"
Me...
Otto called -
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
The family that steals together, deals together...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Come here -
Sure, man --
We can't do that, dude --
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
No. You were replaced by Alex. Who was replaced by Kevin. Who was replaced by Vince. Who was replaced by Mitch...
Kip's in trouble
Six or seven...
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
If you change your mind. We're at Otto's. It's 50 ladies in 24 hours. For The Carpenter. 200 K and Kip's life on the felt. So long now ...
That's what I want ...
Very good...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No worries ...
I've got you floored... We're off ... Take the curb... Man, can you corner... Know not to get on it ... Momentum shift ... Don't get on those brakes too hard ... Get her up on her tires. Up on her toes. Up ... Up... Up.
What happened? Old-age happened. I tired of killing them. I woke up one morning and thought I am no longer a destroyer. I am a means of resurrection. Now. We restore. We revive. There are so few things in this life, we can prevent from decay. Most must die. These don't have to...
The hard part ...
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
In order to succeed, you're going to have to go old-school. one night boost. Put all your nuts in one basket. And...
Sixteen. But my birthday's in seven months ...
You sure I can't go with ya?
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
What? What happened?
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
I understand.
I thought you were going to stand me up. You looked bored. You didn't say anything. What did you expect. Tommy was all over me. Right?
I'm in construction.
Get inside!
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Paul will calm down. You'll see.
I flushed it down the toilet.
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  He was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. Hits never bothered him. It was business. But what he really loved to do was steal.  I mean, he actually enjoyed it.  Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  He was one of the city's biggest hijackers. Clothes. Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes. Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and lobsters were the best. They went fast.
I think you got a good shot at beating the case.
Whadda you mean, you can't make any more deliveries? You're going to fuck up everything?
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
So do I.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Ma!  Please! You're driving me crazy.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
Well you know how he loves animals right? Anyway, last week he's drivin' home... 
Suck my cock!
You're fuckin' good.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Good.
This is your house, right?
I told you, I just got change.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
I have about seventy-three...
Come now...what do you think I am, a juvinile? You don't got any money on you right now. You think I'm gonna take a check? EXECUTIVE It's fine, John, I can cover the rest.
History.
Seven.
Somethin's in my room.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
I'm sorry.
I've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
Really?
Of course.
Okay. How?
I told you to cooperate with these people.
That's fine, but did you ever think--
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
No, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. It was pretty impressive, actually.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
Why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
Where're you going?
Never been.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
You guys are fuckin' sick.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
What does?
I think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
You've never been out of Boston.
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
So Christ, call her up.
Hence, the word remarried.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Where were you?
You should have seen this girl. She lit up the room.
I don't care if Helen of Troy walked into that bar! That's game six of the World Series!
Do you have a soul-mate?
Not to me, they're not.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Over at Tri-tech. One of the jobs Professor Lambeau set me up with. I haven't told him yet, but I talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I'm gonna travel a little bit, so I don't know where I'll be.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Here's my number.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
Pretty boring, I guess.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?
Do you keep in touch with them?
I'm sorry, I been real busy.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
Didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
No.
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
No.
Yeah, but how do you know?
'Cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. I mean, we might be in California next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. And you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  But you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. Now I'm in California, 'cause you asked me to come. But you don't really want me there. And I'm stuck in California with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
Is that what you think--
No, you don't want to hear that.
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Lissen. I don't care nothin' about you, but if you mess in this, your whole fambly li'ble to get in trouble, an' Tom get sent back to the penitentiary.
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
Gallon or two?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Can all of you work?
Joad. Tom Joad.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
No. They wasn't people to write.
All right, you remember the *man* then.
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
I aim to.
But jus' the minute they ain't strike- breakin' they won't get no five!
But we can still do it, honey.
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
No, my old man got a place, forty acres. He's a sharecropper, but we been there a long time.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Hush!
Yes, ma'am.
Put somepin' over him, so he won't git sun-struck.  Ever'body set now?  Awright, Al, letta go!
'S all right, Grampa. You just kind a tar'd, that's all. Somebody fix a pallet.
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
No--an' look what I got for you.
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
That's right. And douse some in it.
On a gallon a gas?  Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
I'm gonna go away tonight. I can't go puttin' this on you folks.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Sure. Good-by.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
But who done it?
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
No. I'm jus' gonna set awhile an' then go to bed.
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
Man bones?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I'm Martin Blank.
So, what are you doing now?
Whatever I can get away with.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
What do you want to do?
I want to be an actor.
Then express yourself, Bob.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Here is now there. There is here.
I'm a professional killer.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Watched television?
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Like love?
You're a government spook?
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
I'll hide.
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
I just know.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
This is me breating.
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Those all seem kind of related...
Whatever.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Never enough.
Yeah...
See you in ten years.
How did you get this job?
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
I'm a professional killer.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Poor thing.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
One more time.
Why?
It's still early. What's your next class?
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
Whatever you want.
Fine.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You were never thirteen, Mom.
That's not true!
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
I didn't see it.
Did he mention it?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
My period.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Tom's gone.
Exactly...
Lucy isn't you. We're losing something without you being here. Now, I know this is a rough time for you, but I think we should make another arrangement.
All right. Speak to you then.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Okay.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
You've already made arrangements!?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well, it's good that you're there.
Night.
How are you feeling about work?
Take your time.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I'd love to go there one time...
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
Oh, how sweet.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
You know, you're a good kid.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Yeah, cool.
See, we're very busy. A TV network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
Devil book. The Unix Bible.
The Red Book. NSA Trusted Networks. Otherwise known as the Ugly Red Book that won't fit on a shelf.
Was that her top?
Look at this, it's so lean and clean.
Meet Cereal Killer. As in Froot Loops? But he does know things.
Stupid, man. It's universally stupid.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
No, don't know who he is.  Do you?
Nope. His mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  He isn't to consort with his computer friends.  The secret service is really out to get him.  Hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Finish up, honey, and get to sleep. And happy birthday.
Mm-hmm.
Nah. I don't play well with others.
Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Razor and Blade.
Fucked if I care, man.
Look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, I mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
My... class. You mean I'm not in your class?
Think you can do better?
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
I have to tell you something.
I know, I know who wrote it.
You what?
I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
I'm trying to help you.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Dreams?
Homicidal?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
You're hopeless, man, utterly hopeless.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Hey, it's me.
Phreak?
What, it left a note?
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Sh, sh sh sh sh.
So?
No one believes the guilty. Besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
What number please?
Thank you.
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
Get up there Rachel!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
But I thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
You bet.
Coming.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Okay, let's go.
No.
Okay, bye.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
No problem, Sheriff.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
Myers has been locked up since before she was born. He's never laid eyes on her.
Find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. Call the local T.V. station. Tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
How do you know?
Yes. Michael Myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
Okay.
Now you understand?
Don't touch him Jamie!
What?
He shouts, too.
We just talked.
Sure, see you later.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
I can't.
He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out. Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so.
Lindsey, open the door! I'm locked in the laundry room!
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Yeah, sure.
Lee Brackett.
TOTALLY!
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Well, she's totally not here.
They probably stopped off somewhere. Have her call me when she gets back. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
But king Arthur was always your favorite.
What about the rest of my comic books?
There WAS.
Promise?
I saw him...
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
HURRY!
Was it the bogyman?
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
Will you get her for me?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
Are there any special instructions?
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Are you really interested?
Oh--
And then, uh, April...huh?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
Hmm?
We're actresses.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  No, I'm sorry.  It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
Really?!
Yeah?
...with the affiliates.
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yes?
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Did you ever read this one--?
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Poor Hannah.
No.
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I don't know.
Me?  Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
Leave me alone, can you?!
This is a toast.  You know this beautiful Thanksgiving dinner was all...
I don't understand.  Aren't you frightened?
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Because he likes you.
Because I have to!
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Oh, yes, you have!
I'm sorry.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh!
I think he'll find that satisfying.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
No!  I like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because I get the attention.  He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older, and I've tried to stay young...at heart.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
Well, how about this?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Really?
You know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Well, I just came from an audition...
So what's new?
Oh, so loosely.
Well--
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
At least I'm open to new concepts!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Nobody ever said it.
Really?
No, the reason I ask is--
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Hmm.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
Oh, who cares?
Just a few minutes ago.
God.
Where are the antihistamines?
Hmm.
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
Take our literature...
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
It's a growth business.
He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or:  "natural composting."  Do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
Oh, yes.  He's found Peace.
Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...are they hard to get?
First things first.
Follow Starling, stake out Starling. Increase the pressure on Starling.  He will come to her.
...they're from Baltimore....
He's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  You Understand...
What reaction?
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
Mmm...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
...what'm I looking at...?
...standard issue...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
Well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...I've got an appointment....
I said sometime it gets so...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
...how so?
...yes.
Why did you look at me that way?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
<u>Yes</u>.
The girl needs help.
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
...what?
Don't shoot yourself.
Fine, thank you, but
I know where he is.
Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
No,I get it, this is my <u>Cavalier</u>.  This gents my Italian Knight.  Take <u>this</u>...  For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
Then what brings you back?
...no.
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Why am I so--That's new--The way I figure it is if I can get through to just one camper...then I'm a pretty incompetent counselor.                                           ] Don't get caught. I'll deny                                 ] everything.                                                 ]
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Your Secret admirer?
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
Yes, it does.
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
I think your condescension is even better.
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
Do you really think I care?
No. Fuck no. If you met yourself as a child, would you hug her and say everything's going to be okay...
You did last night.
I'll think about it.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Do I look like Mother Theresa? If I did, I probably wouldn't mind talking to the Geek Squad.
Oh God Veronica, my afterlife is s-o-o boring. If I have to sing "Kumbaya" one more time...
Ku-urt, I ne-ed an orgasm.
Is she dead?
Jealous much?
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
You're welcome. It's a lot more interesting than just flinging off your clothes and boning away on the neighbor's swing set.
A well-timed lightning bolt through her window and Monday morning, all the other heathers, shit, everybody would be cast fucking adrift.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
"To me though, suicide is the natural answer to the myriad of problems life has given me."
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Yeah. Scary stuff.
You must have had fun.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Did to.
What?
You've got power, Veronica. Power I didn't think you had. The slate is clean.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
May<u>be</u>.
All we want is to be treated like human beings, not like guinea pigs to be experimented on and not like bunny rabbits to be patronized.
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the stove.
Come on through.
Have a nice outing, you lot.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
John has fallen in love with me!
That idiot boarder?
I miss her. I miss my wife.
Bull...
Skin cancer.
Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh...
I crap you not. She was all over me yesterday in the break room. And she was a total machine last night too.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's that?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
I don't work here.
Wow you are out of it.  
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
The car accident? Any of this ringing a bell?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
Allen?  He... he's okay?
--but there's a lot of it still left, uh, Bernie.  Almost half.
So now you gotta wear it, you poor bastard.  Everyday you gotta be everybody's hero.  People watching you all the time.  Waiting for you to make...  a slip.  Slip up.
I got your bail continued.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Do I hit anybody?  You see me shoot anybody?  Hey, drugs!  Do I sell drugs?  Jesus, I don't belong in prison.  I'm a family man.
My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
It's never your fault, Bernie! Never ever!  You screwed up my life, now you're gonna screw up Joey's life, but you're never gonna accept responsibility for anyth--
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
Me!
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
I got a kid, you know.  I'm a person, for Chrissake.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
JOEY!
Mmmmm.  Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older.  Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay?  It don't go no further.  What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch, ..?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Uh, right.  A... news story.
Goodnight, John.
John, I know all about it.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
You're sitting on your ticket.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Helluva story!
No, Deak, not a great story.  We backed this guy, he's our boy!  We gave him a vote of confidence, we gave him a million dollars.
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
So this really does the trick, eh?
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
-- a sense of proportion.
A sense of proportion.
Who doesn't?
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Because life isn't about playing it safe.  Life is about taking risks.
I <u>know</u>.  I just feel that the relationship has reached that delicate stage where the slightest little thing could wreck the careful groundwork I've laid up till now.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Yeah, that was easy.
Just show me the way.
You must value your independence.
Mr. Sykes, I think you should go home.
Aw, okay.
You know how sometimes Neil bugs you and you just get up and walk away from him?
Yes, he did, and I don't like it any more than you do.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
He'll never appreciate it more.
I can't help it if my homework is torn to shreds three times a week by someone <u>much</u> bigger than me</u>.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
You're thinking exactly what I thought when I first saw this house,
You wanted furniture too, didn't you?
You could have a pool to cool off in.
It'll be even shorter if I get that new job.  Come on.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I know.  It's just having to pass muster with these juniors before the senior partner even agrees to see me.
Oh -- great.
There <u>are</u> people who do things because they <u>want</u> to get caught.
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
We'll talk in the morning.
This is a terrific entrance hall, What a welcoming feeling.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
I've been going through a lot of personal crap, all right?
What did the thermometer say?
The thermometer's broken.
Right over here.
No joke, Lieutenant.
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Tough.
I think it was England.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
And Brenda?
I'm sorry about that -- but I had nothing to do with it.
It's late.
Yes.
Leaving what?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
You may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
Different places.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
No -- we're from Strange facts and mysteries.  It's a syndicated show out of..
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
If it's good advice.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
Then who's Russell Nash?
Sorry.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
Why not?
Yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  What if they were trying to get out?
On the back it has--
What's that next to him?
Jennifer, there is more to life than work.
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
I don't know.
I think he's dead!
Chief...it's like none of this exists. I'm sorry.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
We'll burn this fuckin' place down!  I got gasoline all over in here!
The Mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  There's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  I think we could make the transition now. Maddox, you good to go?
We can't forget it.  The Sheriffs think you won't let me talk to Smith because he's dead.  They think you murdered him.
You've already helped yourself once, Dennis; be smart again.  If you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Give up.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
I don't eat junk food.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
Canyon Country.
I still see that boy's eyes.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
Either I'm going to tie you or Mars will tie you.  Which do you want?
He said something about a girl --
He.  Can't.  Answer.
Chief Talley is the one who got you out.
I need to talk to him.  Alone.
Where are they?
Laura Martin.  This is Will Maddox, the primary negotiator --
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Not until the man calls.
Where are you right now?
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
If I try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  They would see you outside, too --
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
What do you want me to do?
He has lots of disks.
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Who is it?
Yes.
Then you have everything.  You can put them away.
You will re-assume command.  In two hours, a group of my people will arrive at York Estates.  You will tell the Sheriffs that they are an FBI tactical team.
We're almost home, you and me.  Keep your shit together.  This isn't L.A.
We, who is we?
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Excuse me, Colonel.
I can't, I don't have the men.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
What did they say?
Bring back your policemen...
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
What is it?
When will they be here?
Very soon.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
I saw the sign.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Can we phone them in, Paul?
That will take time.
You don't have time. If I do not have the names, so that I can pick out the traitors, then I will kill everyone here in this car park. Get in there now.
Don't lie to me. What's your name?
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
Also, this is your bill for the last week.
He wants your wisdom.
Where are you hurt, son?
Stay with the children.
Give him time.
We are almost out of everything.
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
You have taken business class?
Many times.
Boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I'm Tutsi.
Let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
It's complicated. But don't worry --
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
More to the point. Where's our host?
Donald W. Blackburn, M.D.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
Did it work?
Over here!
I told you already: Jennifer Jenzen, Executive V.P. of --
And then where are we?
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
We're safe?
What --
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
I hope not.
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch --
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
No, no, it's just --
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
Maybe if I --
What?
I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
I'll take my chances.
Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.
Pritchett, what is this "core of darkness"?
How, he's supposed to be dead!
-- I'm coming --
Suppose not.
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
I don't understand.
Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
We're going to go someplace new.
We'll get it later.
She's here.
I want this one, daddy.
Why?
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Must be...
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Or what she was worth.
Yeah, well I'll be joining you shortly.  I just want to...
So what are you saying?
Are you ok?
Know what?
I'm ok.
How can I help you?
Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Did you remove anything in the cellar!
Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
What's going to happen?
And what is ... this frozen moment?
Because - monster as I was - I was bound by Laws.  The protocol of Hell.  The Box had to be opened to let me out.  The truly innocent were safe.  That's no longer true.  The shell of the beast has been fleshed.  What I was is out there, Joey.  In your world.  Unbound. Unstoppable.
So where is it?
Taken what?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
And he still sits there?
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
You gonna buy?
Wow.  Thank you.
No!  No.  It's not the same ... I ... No.  What you did ... it was ... evil.
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I miss you too.
Oh, I don't ...
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Terri, listen.       Why don't you come here and kiss me?  I mean, it's probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  Is it going to happen?  Isn't it going to happen?  Let's get it out of the way.  See how we feel.  Then we can relax.  Talk.  You know.
Hey, you didn't fuck it up with me.  You know that.  It was my fault, babe, it really was.  And you know I'm sorry. And I'm sorry to see you upset now.  I hate to see you in pain like this.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
I read about these people in Newsweek.  Where's all the regulars, Crazy Jeff Cava, the Todd sisters, Indian Joe?  Where's Ed Kranepool's autograph?  Captain Bob's steering wheel?
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Paint a woman in a lighthou--I don't want to steal a horse. Life is...
Oh, not much.  Gates just had his tonsils taken out.  The hard way.
Why not just go now?
Last rites, sister?
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Yeah.  The big E.
I'm going to find out.
God go with you, sister.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Like a "cat", one could say.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Remember that shoe you lost...
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Sharp.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Cheap! Cheap! It's never been more valuable! And I'm ruined! Ruined!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
That smart?!
Well, I --
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
...Huh?
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
Now, Aim --
Huh?!
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
He grins wolfishly.
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Nooo, I don't guess you will be.
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
An example must be made!
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
You --
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
Fah from it...
Thank you, Alma.
That's nonsense, Alma.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
You don't believe in it?
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Mrs. Rand was at the Houmfort that night.  But there's nothing wrong with that.  She's gone there for years -- trying to take care of those people,  to help them.
Fortunately, not.  This is my first experience with it as a physician. But I have seen half-witted field hands -- whom the other peasants call Zombies.  I am sure they suffer from a similar destruction of spinal nerves as the result of high fever.
Yes.
But it's so far away...
Yes -- on the boat.
Of course.  It's been nice of you to spend this much time with me.
It'll wait.
It must be hard work entertaining me if it requires six ounces of rum.
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
Good morning.
Well, I had a good time up to a point.
I can understand that.  Everyone feels that way about someone.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
You want that?
Yes.
What about her?
In other words, I'm on trial.
Why?
Because he drove Jessica insane -- deliberately -- coldly!
No thank you. We should be off.
So maybe you'll come too?
What do you think?
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
It's a starting place.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we'll be right back, Dot.
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
You're not going to --
We're not going anywhere.
Ben.
The phone's out.
Hnnn.
Thanks.
Yeah?
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
What are you talking about?
What?
I just can't believe you could be so --
What you been up to?
That's besides the point.
That's besides the point. The point is if I'd had any sense in me I'd have divorced your mother 40 years ago, and that's the truth, and here it is, 1972 --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Well, we can talk about it.
Hi Wendy.
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
Forget how to ride a bike.
Ouch.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
I gotta get to English class.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Pharmaceutical! You are a god.
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
My what?
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
Truly? Do speak.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Yeah. Yours?
I'm sorry if I got you into trouble. Maybe we don't have to, you know... unless you really want to.
Yeah.
Calling an individual, Charles, in New York. Confirming a social outing for Friday night.
Hey Sandy.
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Oh.  We always have play-offs in the middle of the night.  It's the best time.
I don't remember.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
Has her books in it.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
You know what about.
He's asking everybody questions.
We say nothing.  It goes away.  Simple as that.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
I'm always all business.
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
You don't know.
She didn't tell me.
That's what I said.
But she was an attractive girl.
It was when I went to kiss her.  She started laughing.  I got angry.  After all I'd given her.  All I'd shared with her.  I just wanted to make her stop. That's all.
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
Knew? You mean he is...
But why?
You said there were none.
I don't believe you. I do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
Louis, I swear I did not.
You're spoilt because you're an only child. You need a brother. Or I do. I'm weary of you both.
We forgive each other then?
What have you done?
Claudia - don't -
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
The swamp...
And you never cried -
It is! Take the back stairwell -
Not yet.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
But if she dies...
It's only mortal death.
What do you mean?
You want death? Is it death you want?
Yes...
Call him.
But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Give it time. You're like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. It will pass. And we must sleep now. I can feel the sun approaching.
Tell me about him. You must have lernt something from him! It had to happen for you as it did for me!
Respect me a little then. I'm the only life you know.
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
I'm not interested in you. You disgust me. I'm interested in my own nature and know I can't trust you to tell me the truth about me.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
She would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of I know not what...
Louis, Louis, I gave you the gift --- help me ---
Are you mad????
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
We can't begin this way. Let me turn on the light.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved your wife, surely.
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
It's over, I'm telling you...
Yes...
What about a radio?
Phones went down a few minutes ago.
Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain.
What are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I'm not ready to die for them!
No. When I put these skinny pants on my body...Now, that's heart attack time.
Yet. Nothing yet.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
Where is everyone? I'll ask --
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
They never found the body.
We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
...Nancy?
Why are you being like this?
Will you try...for me, please?
Fine. Show me the body.
You don't seem fine.
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Just for a minute, baby. I got something I wanna tell you.
Honey, some folks just can't fly.
Why?
Baby, I finally got you alone in this Jacuzzi and I don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James.
Yes!
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
He leave you?
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
Hey -- shut up, okay?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
She's in her room.
Don't bother. Go to bed and get some sleep. I'll be working late.  I can hear any movement down here.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
That should decide it or you --
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
It was, the plague
No. I mean your other secret -—	the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
Miss Wollsten -— my secretary, she'd know.
Was she ill before that girl came into your household?
Maybe you've got the wrong crypt —— after all it's twenty years when you wore last here.
It is not necessary to understand. We are leaving and I am thankful.
But the war, the army —— they need you.
Don't let it trouble you. He's an old man and these last few days have been a terrible strain on him. He won't harm you.
All right –– all right.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's the kid.
No!
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
The Building and what?
Thanks.
Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend, Peter Bailey.
Hiya, George!
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
Today, over at the house.
Uh-huh.
Fine.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Ummmm . . .
Oh, it's wonderful.
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.  Hey, you! Rummy! Come here! Come here!
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Oh, he's a sick man. Frustrated and sick. Sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. Hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. Hates us mostly, I guess.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
I hope it works.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Where are you going?
Huh?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Holy mackerel!
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
All right, sir.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Me?
Too young or too old?
Have you made up your mind?
Mary . . .
To keep from being an old maid.
Left them at the office.
So's mine.
Someone pop your balloon?
No.
Yee-hah!
I was counting on hours.
That's awful.
We're throwing a rope and you better catch it, hear?
Can you get us a line?
Aren't you off-duty?
If you had a $100,000 boat there'd be an investigation.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
In here.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
What about tennis?  Riding? fixing up old cars?  Bartending?
I kind of had plans....
Sorry, I'm all booked up...  Come, m'dear.
You don't make enough.
What's that supposed to mean?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
Is there one in these waters?
Not necessarily.  These wounds could've been inflicted 30 miles out to sea, or more.  None of them are immediately fatal.  Currents could've carried the body 10 miles further.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
One what?  Ah-ha!
Use the little brush there.  Why were you at Santos'?
It was bad, wasn't it.
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
That's it?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
It's all right, we're okay.
Great.
Untangle it and let's go -- We don't need a blackout on the island.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Might as well.
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
Yeah.
You're going sailing.
I want to go with you!
He thought he had a good reason.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
Well, that's why you got it.
Me.
You don't have to prove anything.
Yes, aren't we all.
Make this quick!
I thought they were clever.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise!  I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  Don't be so concerned about them.  Worry about yourself.
Why are you?
Not good enough.
Sure.
Depends on big brother.
How come?
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
No.  Of course not.  Don't listen to him.  He's - he's...  ... my brother.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
SEAN!
Shut up, Tod!  Be serious!
Gotta sneeze.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
It's not closing, Mike.
Got a job for me?
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
Just find your own.  Like Dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
This company's expanding.  They got parks in Texas, Ohio, California.  I think I'm gonna be going to Waco.
Sure.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
That bugger moves fast.
It's time for tea, Grandma.
He told me you both did....
No way....
I thought artists worked with their subconscious....
Because....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
Off....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
We'll be there....
It's too dangerous....
Thank you....
I didn't.
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
You could teach...You could....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
You just got here....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
It could have been an accident....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
I like to travel....
Why?
My vision is perfect....
Yes you can....
I'm the artist.  Like my mother.
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
You don't have to say anything, Matt ...I know how you feel....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Feathers all over the place....
I'm separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Spade's a garden tool....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
We have at least three months' work left.  We can't write a report...We don't know enough....
The shark will get it for us.
What do you know about him?
Shove it....
Screw you, Jake....
Anything to do before I go home?
Cow tipping?
I'll take care of it.
You'll never guess. Shut your eyes, Mama. Shut 'em for little Jakie. Ha. I'm gonna steal something.  Ha, ha, ha, ha. I'll give it back to you some day, too, you see if I don't. Mama, darlin', if I'm a success in this show, well, we're gonna move from here. Oh yes, we're gonna move up in the Bronx. A lot of nice green grass up there and a whole lot of people you know. There's the Ginsbergs, the Guttenbergs, and the Goldbergs. Oh, a whole lotta Bergs; I don't know 'em all. And I'm gonna buy you a nice black silk dress, Mama. You see Mrs. Friedman, the butcher's wife, she'll be jealous of you.
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
I already did. What's his problem?
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
<u>What</u>? She's <u>blind</u>, Bro. You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano?
Don't start again. If you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
Why?
I don't want excuses, I want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Sure.
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
What about Citrine?
Don't thank me. Thank Margie.
Hey, John, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. It may well have been the local cops?
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
No.
We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
Three or four.
Once.
He says, you freaked one of em out?  "Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
And did they?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Your predecessor. He did- n't like to get outta bed. Catch you later, Freddy T ..
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Me?
No.
I don't know.
You should. It's wonderful.
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
No I'm not.
What does that mean?
Don't mix very well with beer.
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
A derelict.
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
That's right.
Okay, this is working.
There is something missing here.
No.
"It's okay to eat fish, 'cause they Don't have any feelings...
Bill, Rod, wait --
My son... my mind...
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
It's all going to work.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Do you have something to drink?
Right.  I'll come in.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Will you marry me?
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
Thank you.
Ten seconds, Rod.
Do I know everything there is to know here?  You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Yes.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Rod, get on the camel.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Fine.
Beautiful.
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
I'm fine.  What's up?
Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right.  _ 76.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
What'd I say?
Quiet!
A bird cage.
We called everyone, did everything we could. Because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault. Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." You believe that?
That one time was just the bumper.
Think.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish or perish.
Billy, I can't talk to you now.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!
Really?  What do you do there?
Raptors, mostly.
You think they could talk to each other?
The last of my breed.
It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight weeks.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Ajay.  Go on up to my ranch, take a look around the trophy room, and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
It's just fed.  It won't attack unless it's threatened.  Don't move.
Don't start a legal argument with me, this island isn't your property, and neither are these animals!
Oh, God.
What's that?
Because it exists.
What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it?
Ian, they will misplace our evidence, shoot holes in our testimony, and say some special effects genius created the animals.  The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Can the kid walk?
Theoretically, yeah , but we've never shut down the whole system.  It may not come back at all.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
They smell.
What kind of park is it?
Can't we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - barfs them up - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
I can see the shed from here!  We can make it if we run!
I get ah - -
And even if we haven't seen it yet, I'm quite sure it's going on in this park right now.
Alan?
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
Are they heavy?
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
The kids okay?
You're sure?!
Not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds.  If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Who?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
He left us!  He left us!
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
Thanks, Dad.
Why did you do this?
Other guy?
That's right. Wasn't on any of the maps... we could barely see it through the underbrush. Place must've been abandoned for twenty years.
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
He wets the bed?
Great. Battling head doctors. We'll confuse the jury enough to create a reasonable doubt. Hung jury.
This is Jason Voorhees. They'll be looking for an excuse to send him to the chair.  If we're going to argue insanity, we're going to need something a little more concrete.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
We're going to need at least two full REM cycles to get a clear neurological profile. Three hours minimum, six hours ideal.
That's open to debate.
He's my client, and this is important. Enjoy your waitresses.
Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Jason's asleep... maybe he's dreaming of himself as a young boy... and that boy is sitting right here.  I think he's some kind of projection from Jason's subconscious.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
Did you?
-- In what sense?
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
You're detestable.
... My ... social situation?
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
I usually take lunch by the River.
I do.
Why would you suppose so?
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
He wasn't robbed.  He was identified by his wallet.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
And you ...?
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
Can I ask -- how you found me?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
On the contrary, it matters a great deal.  We're engaged in immensely important research here.  I'm a revolutionary too, you know -- but a much more pragmatic one.
As a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement.  Our latest preparation we believe -- we pray -- is perfected. It should take years off her.
Yes.  Isn't it there?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in.  It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Leave it, Ann.
No! Don't!
Oh my God ... Ann?
You better not slow us down, Denham!
That's your monkey, Denham.
What?
Oh yes Mr. Klute -- won't you both join me?  And how do you like our fair city? There's so much here don't you think? The museums and the books and the foreign films -- Bree, have you seen the Godard film?
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Please --
No.
Well I have to close up now.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
I said yes, I see.
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
You said that.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
You said it was!
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
I don't get you.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
I called Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Trask wants to talk with you.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me. 
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
OK.
No. I'm sore.
I better keep looking.
How is it back there?
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Some mistake perhaps that --
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
No.
I looked it up.
Yes?
The prospect of losing my child.
What about your mommy?
Welcome to the... 
Show.
Uh huh...
Then eat around it.
I want my mommy...I want my mommy..
I'm sorry...
See you in the morning light.
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
Where will my toys be?
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes.  Very much.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Either you call and set up the appointment, or I'll call.  And if I call, you lose the commission.
No.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
What about Billy?
What?
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
A few times.  Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
What?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
I don't.  Jim, this isn't anything like what we talked about.  It's not even close.
I don't believe you.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Right.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
Don't worry.  I plan to have something within twenty-four hours, John.
How the hell are you going to do that?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt?  You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
How many onions does it say to use?
Three.  And add some basil.
California?
What?
Ha!  You tell me.
Yes, Holiness.
Can I do anything I want?
But, I am in charge.
And you have horses? You love horses.
No!
It is calm.
I am afraid.
Then, we shall meet.
Far, far away.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
Answer. 
Not until you are eighteen.
It is an island. American territory.
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
I will not go.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
I have smarter men.
You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
The Chinese.
Then, I am lucky. I am still too young.
The people will cry when they learn you are gone. But they would all want you safe.
You are unharmed?
Much too young.
You're all fuckers.  Vicious little fuckers.
<u>No</u>, <u>I</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u>.  The crocodile <u>did</u> kill him, though. But it was all... it was a mistake.
'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
<u>So</u> <u>why</u> <u>are</u> <u>we</u> <u>landing</u>?  <u>Hector</u>.
<u>I'm</u> <u>trying</u>!!!
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
They can survive winter.  As long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive,  am I foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
You're crawling around like a--
Sobek.  Half man, half croc, oldest God--
You do?
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
Thank you, Jack.
Are you sure?
You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
I've come, I'm here, I'm staying. Unless there are ticks.
Who?
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Who taught you be be a nurse?
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
I heard something.
You calm down!
Well...
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
Take him.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
This is a little different.
Not yet.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
You have a thing against museums?
I got nothing against--
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
What the hell?
I'm sorry.
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
I guess.
Me too.
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
Kelly--
Well you <u>shouldn't</u> have.  How did you even know where I was.
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
He's my patient! I have rights!  I'm not just some turnkey, Miss Starling. I shouldn't even be here this afternoon. I had a ticket to Holiday on Ice.
Sir, Mr. Crawford instructed me -
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Point taken.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are...  You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it.  Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me.
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
Where?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Mmm. And what else...?
Terns... If I help you, Clarice, it will be "turns" with us, too. Quid pro quo. I tell you things, you tell me things. Not about this case, though - about yourself. Yes or no?  Yes or no, Clarice. Catherine is waiting. Tick-tock, tick-tock...
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
There are three major centers for transsexual surgery: Johns Hopkins, the University of Minnesota, and Columbus Medical center. I wouldn't be surprised if Billy has applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them, and been rejected.
Nobody sent me. I came on my own.
No! That's incidental.
Tell me his name, Dr. Lecter.
It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you.
You have my word. Paul?
Let's go with it.
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now?  Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I?
Can we rest soon?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
What?!
Why did they turn back?
Thank you so much.
I don't know. Whatever happens you stay with your father. You stay among the officers.
Yes. I want you to go.
There was no letter.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
"Some"?
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
Of course not!  And how is it you were nearby?
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account. She uses us to war against France on her own account...  of greed for land and furs.
Excuse me...
That is sedition! Treason!
That's all, sir.
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
The decision is final.
Fire!!!
Sir!
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Excuse me. What did you say?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
They may leave the fortress fully armed, but with no ammunition... Other than that, ask what you wish.
My colors?
Granted, Monsieur.
Be my guest.
For this...you don't need to be.
Yeah...right...
It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  Most homo sapiens didn't make it...Danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
What has?
No way...
No.
Just get in yours!
Shit...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Well, I always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  How did you know they'd get into the vodka?
Seeing how my stock's doing...
He's not at his station.
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
No sir...I just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
Roger.
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
What was it?
Ah, it's just old, like me. You don't see the Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints...I say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But, 'long as we're here...
Who cares?
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
What are you going to do to him?
Like a leech.
No fuckin' lie...
DeJesus...It's got him.
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
Apart from those shotguns.
It's a Samoan pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Where're the others?
I am not fucking interested.
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a- Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
They were going to pay, then?
You had better be careful.
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
Is there no way they can get back to you?
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?
Out the back.
I like your bar.
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' Who do you think I am?
At what, exactly?
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Er, well, twelve.
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been swapped for a pile of corpses.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
That makes it okay?
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Yes, sir--
I do, sir.
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
He'll live.
You're dismissed.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
That badge--
You got a cause of death?
A .45--
So is Buddy on your short list?
There's gonna be some left over for you, Buddy. I take care of my boys.
I'm not picking it up.
Who said anything about shootin' anybody?
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Yeah, well--
No. You?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
Your mother got a brother--Alphonse--
Uncle Al--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
PDA?
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Tanks, huh?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You own this place?
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Mikey--
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Yeah?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
Because I'm your father.
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Bandidos, Injuns--
Is very beautiful, your car.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Quien es? [Who is it?]
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Donde vamos? [Where are we going?]
Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish--
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
--Santiago.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Open late.
Steve?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Yeah?
You gonna stay out here?
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
It was for personal consumption.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
So I've heard--
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
Weird what you remember.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
Yeah?
Pilar--
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Uh-huh.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I appreciate you telling me.
This isn't Houston, my friend. We pretty much running things now. Our good day has come.
And people better clear out of here! Now!
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Uh-huh.
Nix.
My life was too weird for her.
That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle.  Which was presumably the idea.  These are about Nix.
It's an illusion.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Why?  Because he had you?
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
It was more than that, I think.
He was the real thing, right?
I told you --
Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours.
Yes.
Hang on!
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
I just saw him.
No.  I'm not going near him.
No.  Not yet...
Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
If he was so good why's he so dead?
He was a freak.  Everything he did was tainted.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
What's the difference?
Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Yes.
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already.
... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
Who is he?
At birth.  I don't know you --
Well... nobody.
Have you been in?
They'll never find out.
I don't think so.  You need me alive.
He deserved it.
Will that do?  No?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
And you believed him?
No.
Yes.
Jesus!
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
Fuck.
I don't know.
Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield.
Maybe... I... don't...
And he's dead?
No!
Try twenty-five.
Philosophy.
Thanks.
I know, it's stupid.
Ok.
It's Charlotte.
Really?
And marriage, does that get easier?
Oh.
Where'd you grow up?
You are.
Four.
No, we'll find something around here.
Tomorrow.
I'm going to miss you.
Well, I mean it more now.
That'd be great.
Yes, no.
Yes?
Not all that pasta.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Fine. Is it going ok?
Ok.
One moment, please.
Sushi.
Yeah, like...
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
So you're going to kill her?  Put the gun down Claire.
Quiet.  Real quiet...
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
Not the guards.  Some of the prisoners are easily disturbed.
My secretary?
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
You ready?
But it's true.  I have no faith.  It's strange.  When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened.  It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything.  Not eve my own life.
You need his blood-type.  Like right away.
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
And this is evil?  The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Peter, please...
What?!?!
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
I'm going to look around.
Comfort.
Sure.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
Terrific.
And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
What do you mean by that?
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans.  Parents died when she was 13.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself.  Crime of passion.
Had to let her go.  I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
That was two words.
Yes, we appreciate that.
No.
Always on my ass, anyway.
No.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You lost your head.
What?
Chances are there's still a chance.
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Thanks, Sidra.
You were trying to make me look bad.
What's up, Sidra.
Just not my type, I guess.
I just can.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I don't know.  A lot.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
Kay.
Okay.
So?
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Good.
Yeah.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
I can't be nice to a fan?
Quit.
She understands.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
You weren't at my game.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  Go fuck Dick Vitale.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
What do you mean?
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
So...how's the knee?
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
From basketball.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
What?
Hey.
At one in the morning?
We were just studying.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
You hearing me?
I've been hearing you.
Quincy, please...
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
You work too hard, Pop.
Tell me what?
I just told you.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man.  But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  And another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  And the boldest one is standing right at your door.  And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have.  But I did it cause I love you.
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
Yeah.
I need corrective oral surgery. I need the braces.
ooohhhhhh no.
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Nothing's wrong, I just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's Frank's father --
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It was scary though.
Sure is.  So why call me?
Don't sit down.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
I'm dying, Claudia.  I have cancer. I have cancer and I'm dying, soon. It's metastasized in my bones and I --
I'm sorry.
-- listenin' to that music so loud: You Tryin' To Damage Your Ears?
You just move in here?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Good bye.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Bye.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
You really use strong language.
I'm sorry.
ok.
That was so great what you just said.
It's ok.
What's your name?
Not enough, what do you want?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
DAD --
They don't have substitute teachers where you go to school?
Nope.  So what'd they find out in there?
I'm a rapper.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
-- and I'm through playin' games.
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
I have love.
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
You see?
That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
Braces.
Yes.
Yeah.
Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Fuckin' bullshit is right, in'it?
I'm trying.
I've seen it before.
Who are you gonna call?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
Is that still lingering?
So boring, so useless --
Yes.
And that's what you've heard?
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
What am I doing?
And what did your parents do?
She's my mother.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Uh. huh.
...ok...
...just wait...Dad...you want something...can you say...
You can't just come in here.
Calm down.
I am calm.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
I didn't hear anything.
Will you say my name?
Fuck no.
I'm a bad person.
--- don't.  don't.  Please.  Just... listen to me...honey....  ...I've done...I've cheated on you.
Yeah.
I don't hate you, Jimmy.  But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Rose, I don't --
Paula.  Ellen.
No one else that I know?
Just once.
I don't know....
Maybe...I don't...
I don't know.
Yes you do.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
You're her boyfriend?
No, I'm just a friend.  What are you doing here, I mean...you know Claudia?
You should get one, I'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
I can't.
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
mmm.hmm.
What do you do?
Should be one-thirty.
Why did you do this?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I hate it.
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's frogs.  It's raining frogs.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
My guards are useless!  Take her from me!
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
You are not my priest, Aramis!  You would not be, even if I had one.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours!  It is Phillippe's as well!
In a year, maybe two, I could teach him enough to --
Three days.
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
I will answer all your questions. But first soap, water, and a razor.
At a ball, everyone watches the King!
He lures us to capture.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting.
Save my son, d'Artagnan.
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Phillippe... there is something I hope you understand.  Terrible cruelty has been used against you. And... you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it.
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
Whose rooms are those?
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
You dare criticize my father?!  Or lecture me?!
Silence!  I order you!
I must insist, Sire.
No, Keeper.
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
That food has spoiled.  That is why it was not shipped to the army.
No I mean ours, motherfucker! If I go down everyone's going with me - you and your crew especially! You won't get protection, you won't get the trucks - nothing!
Did you report it stolen?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Did you start out area six?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
What?  Wait a minute -
I don't know - but he's from the FBI.
Where up north?
No.
What did you do then?
Tubbs listen!  I don't know anywhere else to go!  I need your help!
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
1490...Breckinridge...
I don't have any real destination. I'm just going South.
Mind if I come along for the ride?
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead.  I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr. Leeds.
Twenty minutes max.
I'll try to keep him as far away from it as I can...
How much do you know?
The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago...
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
What do you want to do?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Why?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
There has to be.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
Will. Get right back here. He just called.
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Tonic will be fine.
It's a surprise.
You'll come by?
Who?
Some remarkable events have happened in Birmingham and Atlanta.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Was I in an accident?
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Yes.
Yes...
Do you see?
Dr. Chilton.
Hi, Linda. ..
I'll bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
Okay.
I don't understand.
Cut the general crap.
He only bit women so far, right?
What's average?
What would you call him?
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
Blue is cold.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
I'd like one of your cigarettes, please.
No.
Where we're at is nowhere. We have nothing. We're running out of time.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
You got a deal...
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
My name's Will Graham. I...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
You went in the apartment?
Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry.
What disadvantage?
You got it.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
Hi George!
Of course!  But that doesn't mean I don't need everyone's support!  I can't be surrounded by negative energy.
You've got good days and bad days.
No, I'm sure we'll be fine.
Hi... am I late?
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
If you want...
I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the action...!
Then your father's a wimp.
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
So?  What do they know?
It's so dirty.
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now, you're creatively bankrupt.  In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen, Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant. It's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  Isn't that true???
Andy, don't raise your voice.  We don't wish your presence here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
But what's the POINT?  How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
There!
Bob Gorsky.
He'll be contacting us again.
Their next target.  The name is Neo.
And you are?
You all look the same to me.
No, it's all right.
What are you doing?
Honestly.  Morpheus.  He got them all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an agent and I watched each of them die.  Little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  Run your ass off.
Any time.
Cypher?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Goddamnit!
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
He's beginning to believe.
I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
How do you know all this?
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
Go the the Adams Street bridge.
What truth?
What does that mean?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
More important than what is when?
When?
You -- you're too fast.
I think I do.
Yeah.
And she's never wrong.
I know.  That is why it is so important for you to go.  Please, Neo, I'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Shit, I'm sorry.
Honestly?  I don't know.
My name is Trinity.
When I asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  They have to see it to believe it.
A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
What choice?
No, you're not.
No.
Where is it?
Neo, this has to be done!
Trinity, we don't have any other choice.
I don't know.  I lost him.
Thanks.
A check?  What the...hey, where you kids from?
Don't go to any trouble.  We believe you... We believe you.
Be careful.
You are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower I know.  Like to see what kind of business you'd do.
I don't know, but God help him if he does it again!
She don't look Jewish.
Yeah.
And say what?
Panther!  Same thing...
Hey...no more good times like before.  Until you come back.
Not quite...but keep trying.
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Cut it out stupid.  It's me.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
OK.
Get him in.
Ok...that's it.
$20.
Let's go to the movies...on you.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Whatever.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
Hostess?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
What was it?
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
Did you?
Ok.
Take your time.  I don't care.
No.  Of course he lives there. Would I point it out to you if he didn't?
I know...I know.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Count it.
Yeah, I think so.
Thanks.
Ok guys...have a heart.  This is my business.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I know you do, darling.
Who?
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
Who's Annie?
It's for the party, Dad --
It's starting to grow on me.  But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
You mean this, sir?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
No, not okay.  I thought we had a good thing going here.  It shows you never know.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order.  Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
What an odd pairing.
It doesn't matter.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Sorry.  I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I am now.
For how long?  And why?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
Don't you want to hear the details?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
But who is he?  What are his creden- tials?  What is his relationship to you?
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?  Another one of his whoppers?  Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
You get not to go to jail.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Make it go 'way.
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
No.  Nothing.
Good morning, Jennifer.
Didn't you call a Board meeting?
As long as it takes.
Love.
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
Yes.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Has her pain abated?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe.  And you're Susan.  And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
And is your heart beating strangely?
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Where are you going?
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
'Love will find out the way'.
It's a saying.
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
-- Yes?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
Good morning, Bill.
Of course.
No.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't understand.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
Hello.  Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
What's okay?
I'll be the judge of that.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what.  You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
Any universe that exists or ever existed.  You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are.  And you're all fucked up.
I think you heard me, Bill.
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Get him in here.
And we're very grateful.
I guess you have your reasons.
Yes.
Death!
Speak up, please.
Then don't.
Get what?
Time.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
I am, this is it.  B Day.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
Don't get dirty, Dad --
Stay open.  Who knows?  Lightning could strike.
Nothing.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Raise away.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
Nothing.
Nothing to be sorry about.  That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
I agree --
No, it was so right it scares me.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.

Where'd you get it?
Yeah, I remember you.
Expecting any other Jimmy's out here, Memory Man? Where the fuck's Teddy?
Is that what your little note says?
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
Don't remember.
Did you?
Such as?
Just relax.
I have this condition -
That's different.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Oh. But haven't we met before?
So why did you come here?
I want you to forget the company you work for for thirty seconds, and tell me if you really think that Sammy is faking his condition.
You've read it a hundred times.
You're in a playful mood.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Things change.
Guess I've told you about my condition.
Why?
You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.

"And" what?
I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"...
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
I got the item.
It goes very fast.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
Do I need it?
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Stevens?
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
So we can close each other's eyes right now.  Real easy.  Real fast.  But, then, nobody makes any money...
Nothing.
No.  You gonna give me phony reassurances?
No.
Verdado where?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Detective Crockett.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Montoya.  We went to meet the village priest.  It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here's the Pope...of the North Valle Colombia dope trade.
Hi, Gina.  This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy?
How will it stand up?
Alonzo, what's goin' on?!
White supremacist types.
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Hers'n zodda meg a livig.
Scuse me, hon, fraid I'm only half here. Maybe you oughta run on along. But why don't you take this phone number?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
Beat your butt, you don't lemme think!
Same all around! For my friend, too!
Hold it, just hold it. You think I'm that kinda sombitch? Just name your cut, whatever you want, you got it right now. Five? Ten, how's that?
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
What's all this sweet talk about Florida? Your friend O'Daniel got a stable down there now?
Well, uh, my manager's gonna manage all that crap, or else he gonna get a coconut up his flue.
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
The name's Rico, at my own father's grave, a man deserves some respect.
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
Did I say that? Did I?  It don't say nothing about you...
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
I'm wet.
Hell, don't cry about it!
I'm zipping your fly, what the hell you think I'm doing?
Yessir, I can see that.
Olsun - "May it pass quickly." I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish.
History, man, history. How much?
Where?
It's already built!  There's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  We're sitting right on top of it -- here.
We go through the wall?
KNOCK IT OFF!
How's your hernia?
The catacoombs?  Whaddya want, a door?  There's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul.
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
About as good as it looks.
Twelve years.
Seven years...
Thank you.
The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it.
Billy!  Please!
I know where it is.
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Learn what?
That's a great philosophy.
It's not important, just technical things. We make our case.  You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you. It look good. Don't worry.
Jeremy...
Not just any carbohydrates, mind you. It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  We should get a strobe on this thing. Maybe even a siren.
Yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "Epidemic! Epidemic! You're all going to die!"
Right.
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
All right, motherfucker, that's it.
Just do it!
How you know that?  Shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
Someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Nino, please...
Is this a Catholic guilt thing...?
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
No, there's...
Right.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
The scent won't last...
Your arm, you can't...
I can.  We can do this...
I know.  Help me get a sample.
Following me?
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Lucky for you, I did.  Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels...
The profanity bothers you?
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
I don't know.
And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now.
That's the big surprise. Your new studio--after all, writers do need a place to work.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
Annie, what's the matter?
I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
Nothing.
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
Oh.  You can't get this in a restaurant in New York.
The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Don't talk to me like that.
Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles...
Maybe. Are you ready for the next chapter?
I'm almost done.
Oh, I like that tone.
It's good you found it.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Not possible..
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
What are you talking about?
Billy, make sure Nyah's not followed.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Than thirty-seven million pounds?  Not really.
In any case we don't want your cash.
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Exactly where is she?
I am. She is.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Oh.  Well.  I think that can be arranged.
- this is very disconerting..
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Care to wait a decent interval?
They've got a book for everything.
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
And that's the only reason?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Have you met them?
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
Excuse me?
Very.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
I'm fine..
Why not?
What's happening here?  You're dead!
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
They'll kill me.
So what do you suggest?
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
All ten million.
There was nobody on the bridge.
What happened to Jim?
Take off your coat.
This stuff is so sticky.
Go secure.
No sir.
Who else is left?
I don't quite follow you.
You're right.  Maybe this'll save some time.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
You don't know what you're missing. This is the Mt. Everest of hacks.
I can't just hack my way inside.  There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone.  I'd have to be physically at the terminal.
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
Why don't you come back with me?
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Why?
You misunderstood.  No one sees Max.
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
I remember..
Yeah.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
You got it.
Of course I can hear you.
That's what we do isn't it?
The Shawfish?
And I'll have the special fish.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I want you to stop seeing her.
Bed.
I won't come.
Maybe.
Yeah.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
What are you doing here?
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Alright. I didn't see you here.
I like your dress.  It's very bright.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
I know that. I do what I want.
How many men since then?
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
Why you talking to me?
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
That light.
What?
Don't just become excited.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
Oh no I didn't!
What?
You look beautiful. Your hair...
For what?
Yeah. It smells like snow.
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
That's right.
Why?
Is Johnny here?
He's coming.
Ronny, please...
Will you marry me.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Bobo, take the cart away.
On the floor?
Yes, on the floor.
This is a good suit.
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
How about a month from today?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Where you been?
It was a miracle.
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
I don't know.
Where is she?
It's late.
My mother's recovered.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
I am alone in the world.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
Oh.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I knew she had it.
Did you dress her up like this?
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
The Bridge of Death? ... which leads to the Grail?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What is that?
Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done!
None shall pass.
So be it!
I've had worse.
Of course not!  You are English pigs.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Oh, just some friends!
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
You know my name?
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Be quiet!
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
I'm not dead!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Farewell, Concorde!
It just seems silly ... me lying here.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
You must see the doctors immediately.  You must lie down.
Oh ... hello ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Not bad, not bad.
You know what I mean.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
Aye, but will they?
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Quite.
Convey her a message.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
By whose authority?
Her Highness' Equerry.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
That can wait till the weekend.
There are important papers from --
I don't think about it.
Aye.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
What?
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I beg your pardon?
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Who?
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
Of course.
Yes, ma'am.
Unwell?
A few days, ma'am.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Yes, ma'am.
Why is he not here?
He is sick, ma'am.
You can't.  He gets you and you're dead. It's like time catching up with you, you know?  Like Fate.  Each level you get progressively less time to complete.  First half of the game takes place in the Wild Lands.  Then you reach Level 6, and that's the Sea of Darkness.  There's a two-headed Boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right.  If you don't...
What's the question mark?
It's twelve-thirty!
I'm in the middle of it...
Turn if off!
No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway...  I think the game's alive somehow.
You imagined it.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
The Police, then...
I was afraid you'd say that.
Yeah.  The Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
Put in a quarter.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
I'm okay.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Yes...
Of course I am.
Not yet, honey...
Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things...
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
They fired everyone.
No.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Beverly Hills Hotel. I've got enough cash in my pocket for one night.
Cynthia...what's going on?
Git along little dowgie and call me back.
Yeah.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Whatever.
What did I say?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
Now I know a few things. I know you have had a rough day. You're probably thinkin' I don't know the half of it, but in actual fact I know every part of it. The business of gittin' thrown off your movie, the heartache of seeing your wife with another man... losin' access to that precious film vault...
You're an understandin' fella.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Have a good evening, Mr. Kesher.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
But, this could be serious.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
No  There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it.  There are things there.... but I'm... here.
Unh, unh.
Maybe it's not me.
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Yes, Sir.
I just wanted to come here.
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Damn, that's a long drive.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
No...
Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
I'm an investment banker. I see blood bathes everyday. Besides, mine is not to question why, min is but to do or die.
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
How long till the room fills ?
He hired you to build this place ?
What do you mean ?
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
That's a shame.
Yeah a real shame.
That's very funny, sir. You are under arrest.
Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Where ?
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
I said NO.
Trust is earned not given away.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
I had suggested that they tone down the program so that the "guests" might take longer to expire.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I do believe Mr. McCray will be most pleased with the tape of this one.
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Ach ! How will you know if they've made it ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Come to the rescue again I see.
I am equally impressed with your knowledge of the market. How long have you been with the company now ?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
My only problem is that your Uncle Phil is giving me five bucks to pick you up but I don't get paid 'till delivery.
What about living in the real world pal?
Well, we worked on the school paper together. I remember when the Legion of Decency declared Rebel without a Cause unfit...boy...that Jim Backers, what an actor uh? What an actor.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
So, what's on your mind?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Great.
What boy likes you?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
What're you saying?
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
More than anything in the world.
He likes you.
I don't know. And I don't care, Kevin's a jerk and I don't like him anymore. He's all yours!
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
Then I have come to the right place.
I'm Sam Helburn. Sam.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
Does it work?
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
But we wouldn't really be related right?
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Ten bucks.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
You want me to come with?
I should do this myself.
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
You know how I feel about you.
Not exactly.
Nothing, nothing at all.
I mean...with your car.
I'll be here.
Something wrong?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
Everybody did, walk along Citrus between Fountain and Sunset any afternoon.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Good for you baby.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
Deceased.
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
I'll second that.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Pointing upwards Look...
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Hand me the canula.
Dad??
What??
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
This is one big house for one single person.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
I would.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
Oh no!  UUH.
I'm trying.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Uh huh.
What's wrong with your eyes?
What?
Sorry.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I am not.
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
You're right, let's knock it down.
What do you want it for anyway?
For their meat.
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Bye Ma.
I wanna live with them too.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
Okay on the count of three.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
He's still in love with you.
When I'm talking to children.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
That was Thursday.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
He said that, too.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Exactly what?
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Nobody has.  So far.
You don't understand.  I've never felt this way about anybody!
Well, somet...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Quite the little eccentric.
Till the gas ran out.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
What, leaving school...
I never eat when I'm serene.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
Tomorrow is Sunday.  Nobody's doing business.  Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
She admits it's her fault.
Oh, yeah.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Nellie Fox.  Walter likes the past.  And he likes the little guys.
Shhh.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
... I'm partial to the tight end.
You're much more his type.
You're so good.
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
What did you say your name was?
Bye, Bye.
That's what he wants.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
ABC.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
How come?
She's in Paris.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
Your brother?
Harvard?
Sure do. Good friend of Haven's.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
You in music?
No.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.'  But you had to go.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Well, can you tell me why?
Do you like him?
End of Church Street. Next to a grocery store.
I knew when I first met you.
Oh.
That's what you said before.
Premeditated murder.
Yea.
I see.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Linnea?
He's pretty well known down here.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Sleeping.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Oh?
He is to a lot of people.
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
Yeah.
I see.
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
What?
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Let's do it.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me have the keys.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
---and a snake-eye glare, Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had.
They actually apologized.
Where do the air ducts lead?
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Who?
Waitin' in the lounge.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Slate it.
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
How so?
But you'll never be whole again.
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Really?
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
See Duff. He's the money man.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
That's no way to talk, boy. Now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. Stirred up a lot of trouble. They're always after you colored boys.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Where was that?
Make sure he gets those shots.
How 'you doing?
Just so you do your work.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
No. My mother's dead.  You goin' back inside?
No.
Don't Duff--
That's why you come back, huh?
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
How about it?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Yeah, that's so.
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
I don't want to hurt you.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Take it easy, Frankie.
I'm Duff.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
Plannin' on getting married?
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Okay.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Right here.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Negotiator entering Kill Zone.
My man's coming to get my ass out of here. That's good enough for me.
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
And then?
Sorry, bullshit. We haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
Prepping your trip.
It's Case. Remember me?
Jah guides us.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
Who got you into this?
No problem, amigo.
Bright enough to be dangerous.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
We run. You crack the pattern?
You haven't got it?
3Jane's the only person beside Tessier that knows the code.
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I had to limit your options.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
Why would you want me to kill you?
Let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and I.
I think you're full of shit.
Too late?
It sounds like you.
So... did you get a look at heaven?
That's risky gear. It can drive you schizo.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
We've still got to find the mainframe.
Who?
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
YOU KNIT?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
But I don't want it straightened out.
They hid my car--
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
He's my teacher!
I already checked. There are some pretty serious couples in there.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
See!
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Yes, desperately.
That's the spirit!
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
You remember that story?
You have to say that. You're my student.
I don't have to say that.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Do you think you'll find her?
Yeah, actually I do.
Why?
It's really hard to do. Some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
Lock.
And heavy...
For this.
I know.
He stayed a long time.
Specifically.
It's getting there.
Oh, please...
I don't know!  I just know he needs help and we don't know how to give it to him.
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
Get outa here.
What about it?
Yeah, why?
What the hell are you talking about?
Who told you to choke up that way?
Are you nuts or something?
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
It's happening again.
You mean a shithead.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
Oh, Jesse...
You want to talk about it?
We're going to bed.
Thanks, Mom.
I'll need to take her things.
Don't "hi Mom" me.  What are you still doing up?  It's past one!
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
I gotta stay up, Max.
He wears a dirty brown hat.  He's horribly burned.  He has razors on his right hand.
I don't know.  I'm busy with school. New friends.  But I'll never forget the old ones.
To old friends.  And your new dreams.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
Can't be good news coming from you.
I don't do that shit.
She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
Restless.  Very restless.
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
You know what he did.  He's doing it again.
I lost too much over this already.  I'm through with it.
But I couldn't go until I told you how sorry I am for all the things I've done.
I wouldn't be so sure they haven't.
Make sure to check in with Max, he'll give you the 25 cent tour.
Call me Nancy.
Never been here before?
Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much.  your parents still live around here?
My mother's dead.  Died in her sleep.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
That's what I know.
That's right.
Just until we get things under control.
There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
The by-product of guilt.  Psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
They used to keep a spare key.
My God.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Me too.
Oh God.
Oh, stop showing off.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
No.
Hi.
Hello.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Obviously.  Very difficult.
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Why?
Your boyfriend?
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
With a goat playing a violin.
No.  What's that?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
I don't know what happened.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
He wouldn't say.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
I'm sorry I'm so late.  Bollocksed up at work again, I fear.  Millions down the drain.
Working with Leonardo.
You daft prick!
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
The others?
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
I think you do, yes.
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
What are the choices?
Hi...
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Two?  That's it?
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Right.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
Oh sure.  Of course.
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
No! No! No!
Mister McMurphy!
Now that you mention it, I sure would like to call my aunt up in Portland and tell 'er where I am so she can come visit me.
Yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! The World Series is goin' on right' now an' that's therapy also!
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
He's into his wind-up. Here comes the pitch. Strike on the inside corner!
Yes, Miss Ratched...
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
B-B-Billy.
O-o-o-oh...
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Well, shoot, man! Whadaya say we take ourselves a little spin around the place.
Soo, fare-the-weel, darlin'. I'm gone on my way, My wagons are loaded, My whip's in my hand...
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
God Bless America.
What? Where?
I'm leaving. Goodbye!
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
We'll go back just as soon as we find those guys! 'Kay?
Me too...
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
She's not all that homely, Mister McMurphy. In fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
You heard me the first time!
It doesn't help him.
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
That's a dime, Martini.
A nickel.
Yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
I'm afraid not.
Time out!
No, 'fraid not...
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You're breathin' right now.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
You're on!
Shhh!  This way!
I'm not going back in there. I told ya this was a one way trip. Now stand aside.
You's better believe it, brother!
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
That me an' my buddy, Cheswick, we'll be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
Tha's your problem.
Asshole.
Take you han's offa me!
Why, sure, ma'am...
At this hour?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Oh, no, Miss. Not these loonies. These are nice guys. Nice guys.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
What for?
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Yes.
Your hair... is perfect.
Exactly.
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Ha un numero di telefono?
I'm in love with you.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Why are you asking me this?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
So?
Tell me.
Mickey Spillane?
Hi.
You too.
What?
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Well.  Congratulations.
Reptilian swine.  There's no such thing.  Reptiles aren't swine.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
I brought you that, too.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
How about the other one?  His friend.
How about that guy at the bank?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
So, what's your point?
Why don't you ask him?
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Sorry.
Like a detective.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
It was a ouija board, remember?
What?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
You see, in America they care for work, they live to work.  But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
You miss me?...
And we didn't have to bring another present?
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome?  My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three?  So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  So I was wandering around. Just wandering...  When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
Why should he forget it?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but—
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Maybe.
What the hell!!!
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
You hear that, Terry?  Terry, did you hear that?  You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
What makes him so special?
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
I'm with Terry.
I can get home all right from here—
The moment I saw you.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
In a saloon?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
How about another one?
No thanks... .
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You haven't finished your beer.
I've been sittin' in the church.
What I did to Joey.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
My pigeons... .
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
A question of who rides who.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
Good luck.
What did you say?
You go to—
Deef 'n dumb. Somethin' c'n happen right in front of our noses and we don't see nothin'. You know what I mean. No matter how much we hate the torpedoes we don't rat.
But you still hold out for silence?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
Yeah. My own blood— and they sell me out for a lousy bet— I had it in me to hit the top and—  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys— 
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured—  They got it made. Eat all they want— fly around like crazy— sleep side by side— and raise gobs of squabs.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
No?
First things first.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
You ratted on us, Terry.
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Who's to say my monsters aren't alive?
I'm not sure...
Whatever you do, don't do that.
Be careful!
I should hope not.  I hate you!
As I said, a worshipper of snakes, and of smoke, and flames.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
There is yet time.  Don't you want your own pleasure?
Hahh, there is always time... All in good time...there is <b>always</b> time.  You shall have your pleasure.  <b>THAT</b>... I <i>decree</i>
You better hope there is.
You are the keepers of the Damned.  You two know them all. And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment. I want...a decided change.
Ahh, good.  Then I will see them.  Dismiss the rest.
I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a reward.  It could be that <b>you</b> are that reward.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth.  Out there in the free world.
Yes.
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Yes.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.  That's her place.
How long you talk to her?
Forty-five minutes.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
You might not have a choice.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
Whatta you wanna do?
And who watches your back?
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
You talked to him?
In the trunk, yeah?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
You have to know what you're talking about.
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
And you let them come up.  You don't try to make the bust yourself.  You understand?
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
No, I didn't know that.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
There a problem, Foley?
That's right.
I don't smoke.
Let's go outside and talk.
Shit, yeah.  White Boy even got busted for it.  White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Why, are you famous?
You don't act like it.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
Think I could have them back?
How do we do that?
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
Where?
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
In the trunk?
Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
How many?
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Yeah, could be.  Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
Yeah.  If you can step up and actually do it.  Understand?  'Stead of just talking the talk.
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay?  You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Oh...
Flyweight.
You're not my type.
Something better.  Open it.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
No thanks.
Off a tip?
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Hide them?  On a date with pilots?  I'm talking about how you make them show!
Home of the brave!
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Fuck you.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Thank you, Sir.
Sorry to trouble you.
Yes'm.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
No, he...got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
We're all going away.
I had to tell you in person.  Because there's something else I need to say.
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
It must of been a convincing letter.
We must go ahead.  This is our moment.
Have the planes made it to China?
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
Fook ya!
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
Peggy Sue!
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Good—bye, Grandma.
How do you like my hair?
It looks great. Don't change the subject. You know how busy Saturdays are. And I can't do the icing. I always mess up the roses. You're not being very responsible.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
I can't. It's all too much.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Just what you underlined.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Don't say that...
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
I'll think of a way to sell, them.  One day.
I'm not going.
Refresh my memory.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
I have to talk to you..
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
That's real big of you.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Right here. Now sit down.
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
What about Janet?
Then hold me.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
What if we're witnessing the end of touch dancing?
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
But I'm remembering the future.
What are you shooting for?
Is that one of your poems?
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness.  I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms  I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you. 
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
Can we split now?
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I'm excused.
What about?
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
You're a sweet man, Richard.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
Okay. I promise.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
I don't know.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
I suppose so.
Not this dog. There wasn't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
I still can't believe she's dead...
Remember Zowie, Drew's dog? He got hurt again. I'm going over to take a look at him.
I'm really tired, Dad... can I just go to sleep?
Is he gonna be okay?
Nothing. It's just an old ghost story. Let's get out of here...
What did?
I don't know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
All the time.
Charles is right behind me.
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
So what? It's nothing to be ashamed of. You have nothing to be ashamed of, okay?
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
You're not smiling.
Close the law book.
I'm not going to close the--
I'm not ready to die.
Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it!
Honesty is always best.
Dr. Klenstein.  It's not a pleasant procedure, but if the KS is causing the diarrhea, we ought to know right away.
I have AIDS.
Uh, yeah.
Kids are great.
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
My lover and I.
What?
Not bad.
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
Uh huh...
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
You didn't look then, the way you look now?
Yes.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I might.
Great.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You're the asshole, buddy.
Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of the partners. His lover, Greg. Stanley, the guy who's putting in our kitchen cabinets.
I mean, two guys, doing the horizontal thing? I don't get it. Don't they get confused? "Is that mine? I thought it was yours." Hey, call me old fashioned, call me conservative... I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Great, Lisa. Thank you.
Why should I?
A trial takes <u>time</u>, Beckett. Do you know what I'm saying?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
... But now, we're standing up for ourselves...
Yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. Anyone not ready for this?
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Think about what?
Get out of our way.
Audrey?
As fast as you can.
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
But they...they could still be....
What, switch what?
Only around humans.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Shut up.
You said it, not me. Let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
79 kilos.
And what about the cells?
Think a soul could get lost there? With all those pilgrim-types?
He's running us 'round in circles. Look for yourself. Look!
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Nice embellishment.
Don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Just wanted his O-2.  Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.
What, it's broken?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
And even if it weren't, why fly? Where would it get you?
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
That way.
Any particular reason?
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Directly, Mr. President. This wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Huh?
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Taylor.	I'm telling you --
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
Come on. Get me out of here.
To scare off humans?
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
My tribe, as you call it, lives on another planet in a distant solar system.
Then how is it we speak the same language?  Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community you're supposed to come from -- Fort Wayne'?
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
My - name - isn't - Bright Eyes It's Taylor!
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
You threw us together, remember? And you guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.
But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?  You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.
What?
In a few minutes there will be no doll. There can't be.  I'm sorry.
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Shaddup bitch.
You're wrong man! Any way you cut it Rhah, Barnes is a murderer.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
Out there man - behind the log.
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
Yeah, just stole me some from the Top's supply but he's stealing it from us anyway.  Chucks are coming. You better 'didi' man.
March man in Tennessee, sniff the pines... sniff that crossmounted pussy walkin' down by the river. What you got Taylor?  Let's see three hundred and WHAT?
Jackson, looks like you got Elias' squad now.
Squad? I didn't know we was still referring to this platoon in terms of squads sir. 
These two holes are yours...
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Thank you.
I haven't been invited.
If you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
Crossing the border this time of night they're a bit particular. You'd have to prove your identity, you know... unless you've got a passport. They might even want to know why you're in such a hurry.  Otherwise they might think...
I'm Mr. Campbell, Miss Mayfield.  Purely as a matter of routine, I want to ask the name of your bank.
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
He got in here how?
I'd rather wait until it does matter.
Quarter after one. Why?
We'll find out.
He's not a cop. A cop wouldn't have kneed me.
Try not talking.
No use waiting, then.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
And Betty Mayfield--
This must have cost a fortune.
Wonder what?
No.  I paid him off.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Would I want to?
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
A graduation present.
You must come from pretty far South.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
You understand perfectly.
I can't answer that.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Name it.
Quit trying to scare me, Mr. Brandon, I'm neurotic.
Get it in half an hour.
Why not here?
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
Yes, I've seen it before.
On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
We do, when we get the chance.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
Where did it all come from?  Or is that a permissible question?
Oh.  That was just one of those idle questions.  One doesn't expect an answer.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
I don't think you locked your door.
I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
Send that?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
Men like you don't need orders.
You get it's brother.
Unless the gun was slanted up.
Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people.  I'd want to know just about everything about them.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
Yes--and he's already becoming vague to me.  Funny!  Last night I was furiously jealous.  Jealous of what?  I out that gun in my bag deliberately.  Who was I going to kill with it?  A girl I didn't even know?  A man I knew to be a thief and a forger?  A half-man? A gigolo?  It's already ludicrous. Love!  What a comedy!
Now, you're being beastly.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
Yes, sir.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
What are my orders, sir?
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I have a rough idea.
Oh, forget it. Clark Brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. Take me?
In an hour, Larry.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
Good.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
And the shape of it all.  It was sort of...shapeless.
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Not yet you know any of these people?
We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Hold those rights.
Yes, finally.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Why not sit down and wait?
All right.
Take a look at these.
No, thanks Dad.
No.
Promise?
You always talk like this?  You're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
De nada.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I did.  What's the matter?  Don't trust me?
Bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- I... am... an... Eff... Bee... Eye... Agent!!
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
That's right.  And we nailed over a thousand of them.  We did it by crunching data.  Good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  Nobody had to tackle a car once.  You getting the signal, special agent?
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?
The Ex-Presidents are the best I've seen, kid.
The fucking punks are surfers.
This Zen master surfer.
Wait, wait.  Then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  Load it in Bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  You see?  Summer's almost over.  They're splitting. They're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  The next day at the outside latest.  I got a feeling.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
Angelo, it's eleven thirty.
This gonna take long?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Sure.
Meaning you were expendable.
Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
What about the rest of Hopper's men?
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
Who's our back-up on this?
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
The wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
Those eyes... disappeared. But I know one thing, Major...  ... I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
I'll take him.
Why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
Twenty-five percent.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Yes.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
What motel you staying at?
For the whole night?
You're joking.
I never joke about money.
You couldn't afford it.
What's your name, lover.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Edward... you got it!
What?
Fair enough.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
And why do you say that?
I've known a lot of everybody.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
I took the couch.  I had some work to do.  About last night...
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
Three.
Holy shit.
The Rex.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Uh-uh.  No work.
Please.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Huh?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know.  That's the fun of it.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Right.
The young lady staying in your room?
No.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
We just did.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
He's not gonna want us.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
You're a guest here?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
As you wish.
Well ... you were dead.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
No. No. We have already succeeded.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
Veer left. Left. Left!
I'm waiting!
Yes, some of the time. 
It's you.
-- where?
Over the Albino, I think.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, I wasn't nervous.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Okay.
What's that?
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
And what is that?
What?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
Then make your choice.
I will. And I choose --
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
Your grandfather's here.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"I want to croon,
Scared.  Can't talk.
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
I have hurt your feelings.
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Yes, Prince Mishkin, what can we do for you?
Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Two pistachios, my good man.
You found a flop!
Who wrote it?
Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag.
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
No way out.  No way out.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
Mr. Liebkind, wait ...
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Good.  I will make the preparations.
It's that LSD und his verdampter babies!...
Goodbye, my angel ... My angel!  Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia!
Of Siegfried...
Wagner...
And last, but not least, Adolph... you know who.
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
I told them we invaded England.
I'm not the police.
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
Not at all!
If she paid you well?
I didn't mean that as a slur on your manhood. I'm sorry.
No. I told you, she's confined...
Sam, if she's here...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
What?
Can I trade in my car and take another?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
Like what?
What's the matter?
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
She was willing to lick the stamps.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
I've lost my girlish laughter.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Can you?
Uncommon, too.
You go out... with friends?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
Frankly, yes.
Now what?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I didn't think so.
Where will you get the money to do that, Bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
From what?
Indeed, he has often told me.
Okay--I'll be here at eight.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Come on, we're wasting time.
Yes!
Nonsense! ... It's here! ... Your blood ...
Yes, the child ...
There's no child here.
All right, you raise the kids -- I'll raise the roof. I'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
Well, thank goodness, that's settled.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
What do you think I am?
How quaint. But I can go any place you can. 
You mean he was colored?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Yeah.  Have a pleasant vacation?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Hey, Mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on Joan Gale.
Well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
What!
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
Almost certain.
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
Where were you going when you got in that cab?
How's every little thing?
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Old Howard Winton's cub?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
No use. He's a crab, I tell you.
I guess so. But wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Otto! You and one of those other fellows! Come help Professor Darcey.
Excuse me???
A place you've never been.
It's an experiment.
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
But who were they?
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people.
What are you going to do, Rose?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
All right, what do you know?
Reading dirty comic bocks.  And you admitted it?
He's not coming back again. We scared the rascal off, son.  Come on back to supper. Your mother has a theory about how to educate Rose.
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Geccch, yehh, guhhhh!
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
I think Daddy suspects.
Yeah.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
It's Yankee whisky to me.
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them.
You're not having lunch?
I am not being brutal to her!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Now Rose, stop behaving as if you're Bo Peep. Those men had a flight last night because of some female in this house, and it wasn't Dolly or Mrs. Hillyer.
Yes, sir.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
You mean a farm?
I don't believe it.
Galley proof.
Galley what?
Yeah, I remember it.
Afraid of the hospital?
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Well, you run on now.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I was going to tell him.
Cuff'em.  Let's see what these two love birds say once they're sitting in separate cages.
Read my lips: Zimmermann or nothing.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Relax.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Could be worse.  I don't know how, but I'm sure it could.
Yeah.
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
What?
I'm not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
It's just the way things are, kiddo.
It's not gonna happen.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
Can't I?
Don't crowd him.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
Whatever goes bang.
Archibald Dobbs; Certified Public Accountant.  But, that's all we got.
Your wish is my command.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
Beholden to none.
Yeah?  So, what do you want to ask today that I can't answer?  I'm a busy man.
Han will have that shield down. We've got to give him more time.
Yoda spoke of another.
Yes, my Master.
How are we doing?
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
I don't know.
Lower it!
You, too.
We shall double our efforts.
Quiet.
Oh, no.
I see them. Wait, Leia!
So, you have accepted the truth.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
So please don't tell me to can it.
Yes.
Oh Brad.
Oh...
There's no point both of us getting wet.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
Weiss.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
That ain't no crime
No no no no.
No no no no.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
...I don't know.
I think it's closed.
Morning after?
...Guess.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, I do.
Why?
What?
Don't tease me.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
Paulie, please --
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  More ice, now!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
...Still don't feel no heat.
...This man.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
Does that bum have to say that?
Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
Buy us some Thunderbird, man.
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
What about for food an' stuff?
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Ya still light seventy.
Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
Ya sure?
He's always in a bad mood.  Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Yeah.
Rocky.
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
More like thirty.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Yeah, sure.
Creed's great.
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ain't had time to check 'em.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
...Tight.
The story -- what's happenin'?
Maybe --
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Shoulda guessed.
Bastards put him on notice.
Probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Ask her...
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
The other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  I woulda caught 'em if Cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
I ain't tellin' you nothin'!  Get me Santino.
They won't care.  Who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
Oh, sure.  I can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
So what do you want me to do?
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You tricked me, damn you!
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
How do you know that?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
If I'm so smart, how come I'm runnin' from the law with a Toon?
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
What is this, Twenty Questions?
Him?  Oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
Yeah, everybody thought so.  But me and Teddy got a kick out of Toons.  All Toons.  We couldn't see the bad in 'em. And when this guy was accused of knockin' over the First National Bank of Toontown, we took his case.  But when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  We went to his house to take him in.  But he was wise. He got the drop on us... literally.
Yeah?
From this box here...
Tempt not a desperate man!
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
By my head here come the Capulets.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Young Romeo is it?
Content thee, gentle cuz, content thee. Let him alone; I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement: Therefore be patient, take no note of him
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Welcome.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
What?
Ay me!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
By my count, I was your mother much upon these years, You are now a maid. Thus then in brief: The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
I am for you.
Do you really think so?
To make a point.  I don't know her, and I was ready to splatter her brains all over the sidewalk.  I don't particularly like you, so imagine what I'll do if you try anything...
Is that right?
Very good.  Now all we have to do is live long enough to get paid.
Who the fuck are you?
And then...
Some places, not all.  Italy, for instance, they're serious about their food.  But try bloody Britain, anywhere in the U.K., you don't get much fancier than a deep-fried bar egg.  Food's not our thing, you see.
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
Nothing.
That's him.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Check this out.  Gregor's a spook, or he was one until recently.  When he was a spy he lived the life -- you know, a prince in some Eastern Bloc country where nobody had shit and Gregor had everything.  Then the wall goes down.  No more Cold War.  And Gregor is out of a job.  No apartment, no special stores with Western food and video tapes.  I would bet dollars against shit that Gregor liked that phone and he doesn't want to give it up.  And I wouldn't be surprised if he's arrogant enough to think...
Alright?  It's bloody fucking freezing in here!
Next.
Ready when you are...
Don't do it, Sam!
Shut up!
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Whatever you wish...  This has all been a terrible mistake, Gregor.  I wanted to play straight with you, but Edvard insisted we try and kill you.
I'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.
I don't have it with me...
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
Nobody's going to do that!
But first you have something to take care of?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Who you calling dumb, dickless?
I don't think so.
What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Let's just say he knows who I am.
Coordinate what?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Like Larry or Swede.
I wanted to see who you were.
I just wanted to see something.
But how did you know I would have the presence of mind to pull my weapon when I did?
But you can't.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
And what job is that?
I'm going with you.
You see the bullet?
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
It is at that.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
Something like that.
I'll work on it...
What of it?
I'm sure.
None of them had any --
I don't know what you're -
Sure thing, and --
Oh, you would have done great.
They're out of towners... Arizona plates...
Why?  Are you kidding me?
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Come on Booth!  Look at these scumbags around us.  Who's going to know what happened!  Let's take it and get out of here!
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
What are you thinking?
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
That's not what I mean.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
It's the right thing to do.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
I sure as hell hope so.  Let's go.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
Then we're screwed.
Then Sally comes too.
He killed her...
Why don't you get to the point.
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
No.  Why?
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I know.
I used to think he was something, once...  I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
I don't know, Booth.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
C?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Yeah whaddya want?.
Why?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Yeah...see you at three.
It certainly is...
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
It was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  But you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
Did they ever find out who they were?
And what happened?
Well basically I forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
What do you think?  Heart attack?
Is it because of the hookers, sir?  You tell them there's no crime in being lonely.
No, I just assumed...
No, sir.
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
I don't think so...
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
I'm sorry.
Well, hurry up.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you.
You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date?
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
Come on, we still got time to order the Kosher meal.  Always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
How do you know?
What's going on?
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
You thinking about that girl that dumped you?
What about a little king pao chicken?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
I'll give it my best shot.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill?
Dip me!
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
The first drop will be made tomorrow. At twelve o'clock.  The amount will be fifty million.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
OK. Say what it is.
A little.
Look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. Okay?  We're gonna be in some deep shit here.  Working the danger zone. And you need insurance.  Cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
I was being polite.
You don't know what a shortcut is?
It's him.
No, like a tourist.  You know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
Hey, don't worry.  Nothing's gonna happen to it.
Oh, I think you like this very much.
Yes I do. That's all I got. Guts and you, Johnson. There's no one else I can trust.
It's called a dress.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
How much they want?
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
Eleven thirty tomorrow the Ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  He said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
You have what I asked for?
Don't worry, he's with Carter.
After I left?
So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
"Never say die."
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
You can turn that finger around.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
I like it.  This whole thing is pretty incredible.  I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Of course.
Yes.
I already explained about that.
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
And the church.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
Yes.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Nope.
He's got a houseboat.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Happy New Year.
No.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
I told you.  Nothing --
Nothing's with me.
Actually, he sounded nice.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
I love you, too.
Good night.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Okay.
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I know.
Come on, Jonah --
Howard.
It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
What?
It's a sign.
Shhhh --
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why me? What about Jay?
Thanks, but I'll pass.  It's kind of a big night.  I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there.  Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Right, right.
Seventy... eight.
You'll see.
I don't get it.
Eighty dollars.
It's a spice rack.
P.  Dad?
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
I don't know.
Good.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
Okay.
Everyone at work heard you.
It might be in the kitchen.
Are you going with her?
When I found you?
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
You could have called me --
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
Naturally. You think I parked here for a cup of coffee?
I say we gotta take action. Now.
Who? A scab?
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
No, Estellita.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
What has it got me, your union?
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Shut up, you're talking crazy.
No. New York.
Are we talking to a union spokesman?
Yeah.
What can I do for you?
First rate, ain't it?
It's downright classy is what it is.
Everything go?
It's not that easy.
I can't.
I can't leave.
That's long enough to get out of town.
What happened to your eye?
Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
I been that way ever since.
Why?
Hey, you did the right thing. You wouldn't have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. They have eaten your ass alive.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
Guess it's our turn.
I know a buyer.  Guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
Can you set that up?
The Del Ammo Mall mostly.
Not tonight.
Was he the president?
Yes, Jimmy
Yes, Jimmy.
That was my idea.
No last name?
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
I thought you'd be happy.
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
The Mexicali Boys
I still don't know what you're talking about.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
No.  You've got me all wrong.  I mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
No.  Right here on the beach.  Come on. Let's do it.
Look at that place. It's creepy.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Casualties?
Spit it out, Captain.
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Wade, Sarge, Corporal Insect, all of us, hell, I'll bet even the Captain has a mother.
Just shut up, Ryan didn't kill Wade.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Looks like a flaming asshole to me.
Cap'n...?
Of course, sir.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
It was nothing.
You know classical music?
A machine gun.
Sure, you got one?
Hell of a mission.
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
How about I go right, sir?
How about you shut up and take your position?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Bits and pieces.
Simple, numbers.  Every time you kill one of your men, you tell yourself you just saved the lives of two, three, ten, a hundred others. We lost, what, thirty-one on the cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times that number by putting out those guns.  That's over three hundred men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand. Then thousand.  Any number you want. See?  It's simple.  It lets you always choose mission over men.
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
I think you're right, Keith.
I'll do my best.
Out of the mouth of babes.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Yeah, how so?
Huh?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Have it your way, Captain.
Here they come.
Alright, come with me.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Out of the frying pan, into the fucking latrine.
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Excellent.
I still am.
Going out as friends.
Okay, I got it.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
Come on, it's graduation.
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
I just had a phone call.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Dad.
Crash paranoia.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Sit down.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Just finishing up in here.
Honey!
Swear to god.
I swear to god.
I made their lives better.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Yeah.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Hmmm....
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Sure I do.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
You know what?
What?
So what's your job this summer?
Job?  Being a great date.
Mmmm.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
No.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Right.
Am I wrecking my car?
You're cold.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Is this because of your dad?
You do?
One more time would be nice.
No.  You just described every great success story.  Alright, it's alright.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Uh... okay... um...
No.
No, really.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Lloyd.
Hey.
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
Sir, the list is correct.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
I'm sorry to hear that.
In Breslau.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
God bless you, sir.
There's nothing in the stores.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Things are great, things are great.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
Oskar -
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
I didn't do enough.
Of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  What is this?  I'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  We take from each other, we take from the Army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
Hang up...call...
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Where is everybody?
I'm inquisitive.
What?
Already did. He's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
But you’ll never get away with it.
Should we be worried about this guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
I'll get my jacket.
That’s quick.
You’re not going to get away with this.
You’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. It’s a whole world, Sid. You’re really popular amongst the demented.
You’re the one who got away.
Until now.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
Tails.
I think you're all an act.
Not good.
Billy had alibis too.
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Watch your back.
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
My morn was a Delta.
But who would operate your camera?
Too bad.
What?
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you down too. I'll be alright.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
Where you going?
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Alright I'm here. What the fuck do you want from me?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
So is that why you're here? Is that why you're holding me from my show, to tell me about some brutal homicide I'm not even involved in?
I wish that was all Miss Weathers, but there's more. The killer left a note.
Yes well we have a suspect, so don't get that worried.
Why didn't you tell me?  This is my mother, Dewey. Why didn't you say something?
Catch him, or kill him.
Police are still searching through the debris. Could be days before we find her . . . that is, if she's even there.
Is that a threat?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Someone stole Sid's file?
But you know who she was.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
I am Gale Weathers!
There a story in that building?
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
I'm saying things got out of hand.  Maybe they did take advantage of her!.  Maybe the sad truth is, this is not the city for innocence.  No charges were brought.  And the bottom line is, Rina Reynolds wouldn't play by the rules.  You wanna get ahead in Hollywood, you gotta play the game, or go home.
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Page 22..  Ring ring.  Hello?
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
Who is this?
How do I know their voices are --
You follow directions good. Now let's wrap this production. Go to the Sunrise Studios backlot. I'll call you when you get there.
It's good to see you again Sidney. I was growing real impatient. Go ahead. Explore. I'll catch up with you later.
You know it.
And if you get it right -- you die.
You sleep in THAT?
And I was home, bored, watching television, THE EXORCIST was on and it got me thinking of you.
You know that's not true.
It's been a year since she died.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
I called my dad.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
I want to talk to you for a second.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
You're making popcorn?
So, you gotta boyfriend?
His name wouldn't be Steve, would it?
Then he dies. Right now.
Come on, yes you do.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Your call.
Well, we can hope, can't we? We certainly don't have any leads. A ghost mask, a cellular phone -- not much there.
We're tracking the cellular phone bill.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
Mind if I join you?
Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything...
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Yeah.
Drive by patrol.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
Do you still think he's innocent?
For attention. The girl has some serious issues.
And why would she do that?
So who are you?
That's the original part.
Who are you?
Got it.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
She's saving herself for you.
Because he's probably dead. His body will come popping out in the last reel somewhere... eyes gauged. See, the police are always off track with this shit, if they'd watch PROM NIGHT they'd save time. There's formula to it. A very simple one. Everyone's always a suspect -- the father, the principal, the town derelict...
And what would be your motive?
I had 'em hid in the foreign section.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Whatever. Just hurry.
Just a sec... I need to talk to someone.
And you believe it?
You're right. I'm cracking up. Ignore me.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
For once, Stu, drop it.
Okay, but whatever you did -- the entire student body thanks you.
Tits -- see.
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Good.
Really?
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Yeah, that's true.
I read about it in the paper.
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
It doesn't matter who I am.  Who I am means absolutely nothing.  You need to turn left here... at the traffic light.
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
Murderers like you?
I realize that.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
Guessing at this point is useless.
Good.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This was one sadistic motherfucker.
Can we talk about this in private?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
Tonight.
What about sports?
What about them?
Look, I appreciate being able to talk this out, but, uh...
Attrition.  When you regret your sins, but not because you love God.
Nothing.
Just wait!
Then, you tell me what you think we're doing.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
I'm, sorry, but even the most promising clues usually lead only to other clues. I've seen so many corpses rolled away... unrevenged.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Who pays the rent on time.
Oh, blah, blah, blah.  The guy's insane.
No.
We don't know for sure...
Yes we do.  Here...
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Him?
You got to be kidding.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
Then, he must write about these murders.
Sounds like a father who wanted his son to follow in his footsteps.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
I can't let you do this...
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
I guess I won't be showing it to him then.
I don't sleep very well.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
How should I know?
An' she's got a beau! Kisses him, too!
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
Now, now...let's not grow dis- putatious...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Sir?
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
I've come now...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
And maybe you lie...
You've done a lot of growin'...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
You all settled an' comfortable now?
Cut it out, will ya...
He's got to...All these years, run- nin', dodgin', knowin' we were after him...Now we caught up...It's him or us.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Ain't worth the mendin'...
It isn't fair...
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
In the cellar, I think. Wait, I'll take care of it.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
My father was an electrician. Already forgot that?
What?
Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Maybe an animal.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Ah
Yes.
When I have fifty pounds.
The title?
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
No, no. You have a wife, children
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
So now you are free to love
So what do we do?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
No, then.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
What? Who?
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
I have. And chinks to show for it.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
And yours?
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
Do you think?
"Of love?"
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
Verona again.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Above Lord Wessex?
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"I come, anon--But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee--"
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
"She speaks.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
You can bring them with a word.
And that was only my first try.
It was the owl--come to bed
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I am going to church.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
But what of Lord Wessex?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
A theatre poet?
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
I was trying to educate you.
You're a bad loser.
He couldn't get his car started.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
You know what I'm talking about.
How much did you pay?
I fitted a lock up there. On the inside.
Nothing.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Cover it?
Well?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Just serve.
He even signs them, in his own name, can you believe it? I'd sign someone else's name. I'd sign his name. If I wrote them, that is. Which I don't.
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
He's got a car?
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
Yes.
I wonder how he killed himself. I presume that that's what happened. What do you think?
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
Is that all?
I don't thinkI can.
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
You were magnificent.
Who was it?
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Forget it.
No.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
It's the only way.
No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.
I'll wait there.
No.
There are only two other people in the flat.
No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Two hundred pounds?
That's right. You're going to Rio. Rio de Janeiro. On your own. Come on, you should know. You bought the fucking ticket.
Exactly what I was --
That one, last week.
No.
It's an improvement.
And what do you recognize, names or faces?
I mean, that's what it's like.
And you said you supposed so, but I wasn't offering it for debate.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
My keys.
You mean that girl, don't you?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I don't know.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
I don't want to talk about it...
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Right now, I just don't care.
... what?...
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
... just, you could look very heavy...
What?
Yeah...
That you're just like your mother.
Yeah.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
You promised you'd do the show.
Oh fuck, Norman!
Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
He's a very private person, actually.
No, I'm sure.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
It's hot in here.
And?
Did you?
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
He's a director.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
He never stopped.
-- ass and legs --
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
-- well you better go after her.
What for?
-- Oh yeah.
What're you talking about?
What's gonna happen?
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Fine. How are you?
You're different.
You're great.
Yeah.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
I'll call you.
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
-- yes.
But Mr. Norman said --
Said what!
Yes it is.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
Oh yeah.
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
All night.
But...
Didn't they tell you?
No thanks.
Okay, thanks.
I'll have to wash one out.
Me!
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
A soap?
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
What was it, somebody's daughter?
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
See you later.
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Nothing.
Well, it's George.
But you have problems?
He does?
Well, there was this one time --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
That's right.
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
Three weeks.
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
John...
Yes, Dad.
Who says you ain't supposed to?
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Why not?
Sure.
Delbert Grady.
Perhaps they need a good talking to, if you don't mind my saying so. Perhaps a bit more.
I did?
Good.
Pleased to meet you.
Yeah... that's all it is.
Wendy,  let me explain something to you. Whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you're breaking my concentration.
Yes.
And you didn't see anything at all?
Yes.
Jack...
How do you like it?
Wendy!
Give me the bat.
I'm intrigued.
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Hi.
Fine.
Blue. This blue.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
Jane-
What?
Yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. Okay?
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
There! You see!
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
SING! SING AND YOUR SPIRIT WILL SOAR!
SING!
'Cause we love it so damn much.  And cause we gotta come here.  Probation.
What?
Vince...
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh-huh.
Yes, Betty?
I haven't heard that song in ages.  The Ronettes?
Oh, right.  At my old place, we used to... wash cars.  Groom dogs.  So... nice loom.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
I knew that.
A bunch of real mama's girls.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
Really?
Mary Robert, I've watched you.  You never really sing.  You whisper. Nothing comes out.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
I WAS HELL-BOUND, YES THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY SATAN WAS WAITING
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Sit down.
As of now, and until you leave, you are Sister Mary Clarence.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
I got it.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
I am?
What?
Please let me try.  I'm begging you.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
Don't push it.
So I don't shop.
I never said he was an altar boy, okay? But he sent his goons after me!  They tried to kill me!  I'm not kidding!
Screw you!
Get a stenographer.
Maybe Hawaii.
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
I am?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
I think they'd understand.
Oh-huh.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
Who are you guys?
Where is she?
Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
Neither did you!
It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Impossible.
Yes?
Since Mary Clarence came to St. Katherine's, I've been shot at, kidnapped by Mafia hit men, and I've tasted beer. Is that enough experience yet?  For final vows?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
It's that call you were expecting, Vince.
Can you hold?  Can you try?
This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken?
Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
What?
Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here.
Have they nothing to fear presently?
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
I shall, gladly.
Excellent.  Then, you are excused till morning.
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck?
I deserve to help you.  Don't you see how much this means?  My father... he... he was a good man...
His teeth.  Someone had cut them and chipped off rotten pieces far back in his mouth.  The Lenape could not have done that for himself.  Someone out there cared for him.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you.
We should go.
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
Memories have come back.  I had them forgotten, and wish I could forget them again... but they are here now.  Lord, how I hate this place.
What did you say?
The skull is gone.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo.  Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes.
What... ?
Turn around.  Now!
In a way, yes.
Sit.
You want to see into the nether world... I can show you.  Whatever you see, do not move or speak.  I will hold him.
He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Well, yeah it's a classic. You know, Karl, I got to thinkin' about it last night and it's just not Christian of me to not let you have a key. I mean you been in lockup so long, you don't need me keepin' you locked up. You need to come and go as you please. Here, take this key, it'll get you in and out that back door.  Them french fries good?
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
If it works out and all, maybe we'll get you a key so you can get out at night if you need to. See you later.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
You done fixed it? I'll be damned. Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed. 'Course Scooter's about as shitless as one poor son-of-a-bitch can be. You done fixed it. I'll just be damned. See you tomorrow.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Scooter, let's me and you go over to Dairy Queen and pick up a few things for lunchtime.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Karl, come over here. I want you to meet your new boss.  This is Bill Cox, runs this place. Says you can work here and stay in the back.
Doin' pretty good. Got a sick tiller here. What's got you down this way?
Don't say nothin' about that boy.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
That might be better than this.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
Goddamnit, I'm talkin' to the man. You set right there, Karl.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
If y'all don't shut up I'm gonna go out of my mind. And plus you're liable to bust a spring in Karl's head. He's already off balance.
What are all them books?
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Well, anyhow, I was just fixin' to go see my mama down at Ben's Dollar Store. She's workin' two till eight.
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
Who did you kill?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Naw.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
Oh, jackin' off?
Why not? It died?
That don't seem right. It seems like you should have kept him alive and took care of him if he was your brother.
You will? For sure?
No sir.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
That feller's a whole sight meaner than me. He'd just whup the tar out of me.
Nice to meet you, Karl.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
No, honey, we don't.  I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
He's lyin' Mama. He ain't gonna do better.
Yeah.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
We sure like havin' you.
What brings you back?
Do you have family here?
How long have you been standing here?
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I reckon not.
Not funny, ha, ha, funny queer.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
I don't reckon you have to go with women to be a daddy to a boy.  You've been real square dealin' with me. The Bible says two men ort not lay together. But I'll bet you the Good Lord wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.  That boy lives inside of his own heart. Hits an awful big place. You take care of that boy.
Hey, you're the one that wanted to major in journalism. Anyhow, wasn't the guy something like twelve or thirteen when he did it, it was twenty-five years ago, he probably doesn't even remember it.
No, we have to get this story.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Yes.
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
Actually, I'm his father.
I'd love to.
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
How'd you get started?
A photographer ...
You'll never get it if you don't slow down, my friend.
Slow down, huh?
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
She probably died.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
You don't give up, do you?
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
No you're not.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
Sure thing. See you later.
It'll never be finished.
I just do what you tell me, Auggie. You tell me to sweep, so I sweep.
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Just passing through.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
You shut your mouth! You shut your mouth now!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
I can't believe I did that ... Christ. I'm walking around in a fog ...
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
I used to have one, but it broke a couple of years ago and I never got around to replacing it.  I'd just as soon not have one anyway. I hate those damn things.
He's dead?
Twelve, thirteen years ago.  Actually, he died with his sketch pad open on his lap. Up in the Berkshires one weekend, drawing a picture of Mount Greylock.
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
Okay, okay.  It's all so stupid.  There's this guy, see. Charles Clemm. The Creeper, that's what people call him. The kind of guy you don't want to cross paths with.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
The inspiration.
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
I mean earlier. We could have planned something.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
Research. I worked the scene right into my story.  That makes the medical bills one hundred percent tax deductible.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Medium rare, please.
I'm a hemotologist, sir, I was asked only t...
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
I'm sorry about that.  It wasn't mine in the first place.
Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in <u>advance</u>?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
Closer to eight.
So, five hours.  Plenty of time for a call.  He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Up in the air?  Was <u>that</u> your reaction?
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
He hit his head.  On the way in.
Well, anything coulda caused that.
I'll take two.  One for later.
We have a warrant.  To search your boat.
I should show them an American?
I want you.  To tell the truth.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
No spare.
For the third time, yes.
Yes.  And that one, too.
Wanna see my driver's license?
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
It's entirely mutual.
Fresh!
Manhattans?  This time of night?
Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
Where were you guys?
No we're not.
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Of course, the landlady is going to lock us out - Moe said no more knackwurst on credit - and we can't borrow any more from the girls, because they're on their way to jail -
We're not too late, are we?
I'll think of something.  Don't crowd me.
The police?  We'd never live to testify. Not against Spats Colombo.  Wabash 1098.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
Now you tore the other one.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Blow where?
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
But this is so humiliating.
This happens to me all the time in public.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
And what are you trying to do to poor Sugar?  Putting on that millionaire act - and that phony accent -  Nobody talks like that!  I've seen you pull some low tricks on dames - but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest -
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I am.
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Shut up and keep packing.
Okay, Joe.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
No tricks, no mirrors, nothing up my sleeve.  It's on the level this time.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Terribly sorry.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I'll say.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
And your head is hot.
Isn't that ridiculous?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
Okay.
I'm a what?
Or was it Bryn Mawr?
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
You like it?
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
No - it's showgirls.  I've been married seven or eight times.
Most of the time I slap it.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
Yes, Osgood?
Come one!
And I can never have children.
Well - nobody's perfect.
What a heel!  I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled, I buy me a new negligee, I bake him a great big pizza pie...  - and where were you?
You got it.  It's six dollars a man.  Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock -
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
If they catch me once more, they'll boot me out of the band.  You the replacement for the bass and the sax?
Where did he conduct?
Then why did you take this job?
Bingo?
That so?
About what?
What's in Florida?
You're entitled.
What else?  And was I ever crazy about him. Two in the morning, he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad - they were out of potato salad, so I brought coleslaw - so he threw it right in my face.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
What makes you so sure?
I wish you'd make sure.
Thank you.
Not very likely.
Are you staying at the hotel?
Not at all.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Up, up, up.
So do I.  as a matter of fact, I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.
- Inauguration balls -
I'd like to - but it may be rather difficult.
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
It's the thought that counts.
Just regulation size.  We have three like this.
Love it.  Which way?
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Yea, of course.  Now where could they have put it?  On Thursdays, I'm sort of lost around here.
What's on Thursdays?
What happened?
You poor, poor boy.
What else is there for me? 
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
From a rich millionaire.
You see, we have those oil interests in Venezuela - and I just got a cable from Dad - the board of directors decided on a merger.
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
I knew you would.
Embalming people with coffee - eighty-six proof.
We got different information.
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Spats Colombo.
Bacardi 151.
What? Why? What do you mean?
Why, with you.
I’m not as square as my daughter thinks.
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
She did?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Doesn’t look like nothing.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Right. Seven.  Christ, that’s a long time, isn’t it?
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
Kat.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I don’t know.
This happened to you?
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn’t be violated.
Not dollars. Pounds.
It’s my job.
Spontaneously combust?
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
And so you did your job, right?
What do that mean?
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Here, put my jacket over you.
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
I think so...
That musta been afta they sent me to this place call Clayburn. That was the hardest workin' camp they sent me to. The work was so hard, you had to look for somethin' to laugh about to keep from feelin' the whole pain in your body. Like one time, it was in the middle of the day, and there weren't no sun -- you hear that?
What happened afta that?
September 4 -- how far away is that?
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
Same as we -- they pray.
David, come back here!
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Good night, Mama...
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
Come in, children.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright! 
Somebody told me Nathan was back. How is he?
The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
But, Nathan--
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
My head hurts.
Notice that nothing happens.  Now say 'Montana.'
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
How the fuck should I know!!
Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like Ike!
It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!
No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I don't have to pay him!
Oh.
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
I don't have proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores, Kenny!
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
The N word?
HOW THE FUCK CAN YOU NOT GRADUATE ME?! DOES THAT MEAN I HAVE TO STAY HERE?!
I know what it is!
A hunger strike? For what?
We already know what you did. We saw it on television.
You boys need help.  There are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE!!
Guess.
Uhh... Bacon.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Oh... Alright, back you go.
We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
Huh?
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
Yes ma'am!
What the hell is going on?!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
Terrance! NO!
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
I know.
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
You don't get it Stan... You just don't get it.
What's the matter, Wendy?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
He's shutting off the air!!!
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh Sara...
Excuse me?
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
It certainly is.
They are awaiting further information.
Look answer my question!
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Why don't you reset and run it again.  The pods check out ok.
Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Ok, I will.  The bad news is the ship is history.  Life support will last another 36 hours, maybe.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Even if we do, it might be too late.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
No...
Hopefully sooner than later.
Are you nuts!  It's too risky!
Baby, take it easy.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
That's affirmative.
Maybe I should have left the ball in the car.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
I couldn't care less.
I am underground.
Cool!
What did your dad tell you to do to Buzz? Theo scrambles up the lane on hands and knees. Junior catches him, grabbing his ankles.
Who's there?
J'you-and-your-friend do it yet? 
Someone wants to play with me?
You know who I am?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
Bowling "Center"!
Hello, Violet. How's my favorite 'bowlerina' doing?
132, 154.
Like this?
I'm a bowler.
I'm not here to - I can't...
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
No. Not at the present.
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
It?
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
I didn't stop to take his pulse.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
I am a professional man.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
Basement bingo?
Tell your little pal to let go.
Please, Dr. Levine.
Nobody move!
He's right beneath us.
Captain.  Right, forgive me.
Press?  No, I haven't.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
As best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
-- Wait a second --
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
Everything can be killed.
No "buts".  If he wants to be left, we'll leave him.  Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a report...  Hello...  Yes, a report. Gimme... shit.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
Wait a second --
At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
The what?
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
She wired this system.
The wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we've seen.
To what?
Captain, I personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
What?
What sub?
No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
What do you mean -- not normal?
What are they?
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody.
You bastard.
It's not worth the risk.
You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.
Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get outta --
Why should I go?
In case you die, too?
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
But how?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible?  It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are.
Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all we need.  To get him unconscious -- put him under.
Antibiotic.
It's like a sleeping pill?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
I did do that, didn't I?
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
No, he can't.
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
It's either this... or I kill you.
Don't you know?
Top shelf, is it?
What?
You hear that?
Get away --
Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I only deal with facts.
For whoever's in that thing.
It's an American spacecraft.
We can refuse to talk.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
Is it coming from our own computer?
You holding up alright?
I'm not being defensive.
To what?
Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
Then what, Norman?
Page 87 of what, Harry?
You didn't say that about the food?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
The three of us.
How far away's the sub?
I heard!  I heard!
What is it, Harry?
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
What was that, sir?
You mean you don't know?
Who's everyone?
Geologists?  At a plane crash?
Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  There's no head, so I'm guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
Why's that?
Not that I know of.  Why?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
They never used to send a Navy car.
All right then, we'll use your plan.
It's not good... unless I could find the Crystal.  Then it could be very good.
I'm not going out there.
Oh, so you're a warrior then?
A Jedi's power is measured by the amount of the Force that is stored within him, and I have little of the Force left in me.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
I rarely use it any more.  I have the Force.  The Force is more powerful than any pistol.  You shouldn't put too much faith in that weapon.  Work on becoming aware of the Force... learn to feel its presence within you.  Try to sense what it's telling you.  It's the only thing you can rely on.
What do I do?
You go after the princess. I am an old man and would be of little help.  I must try to find the Crystal.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Yes, sir.  I was considered one of the best bush pilots on Sullust. I've also had six hours on the T-2.
Yes, sir.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
Did it occur to you they might find us?
I think I did.
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Are you safe?
Threepio!  Shut down all garbage mashers on your level... Do you copy?? Threepio, shut down all garbage...
I'd consider it an honor.
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
Death to all bugs !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
I got Games & Theory.
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Only when I give you an order.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
Me, too... Day and Night-Cycle.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
Yeah, sure, I guess.
You two have so much in common.
Shhh...
Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I'm glad you're doing so well. If they haven't made you squad leader by now, I'm sure you will.
You don't look very happy to see me.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
What ? You think I joined the Mobile Infantery because of you ?
No, you're gonna be alright, Diz !
Yeah ! We'll talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
Oh, is that how it is ?
They'd rather spend our lives than risk their ships. Who's got the nuke ?
Sounds more like some idiot at Military Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
Bugs don't lay traps... They aren't intelligent ! Unlike you, they're stupid enough to follow orders !
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have everything else, eh ?
Hey, just calm down, I'm giving the orders here-
Been better, buddy.
Uh, I don't know.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
The carbon-units infection will now be removed from the Creator's planet.
It expects a return signal now, ordering it to transmit that information to the Creator.
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
Engineering...
You are what...?
You saved the ship.
That thing is twenty hours from Earth. We know nothing about it yet.
The question is, Mr. Decker, <U>is</U> there a next move...
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
And plug the signal directly into the circuitry at this...  ... point here, Captain. It should pick up even a tricorder playback.
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
And whatever you sensed out here....
... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not.
Our... 'insignificance'?
Ilia's memory, her feelings of loyalty, friendship, obedience... might all be there.
New crystals: they must contain the most recent data obtained --
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
The point is, Captain, <U>twenty-two</U>    
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
Helm ready, sir.
Well, it had sentimental value.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
What's it called?
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
I understand...
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
For example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  That's a fine house.  You look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
I...I decided to give it another chhh...
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
I...
That's for sure.
Cast stood me up.
What?
My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...
Would you go in...
You have to sign for it.
I used to go out with a politician.
Go you Huskies!
What've you got?
I hurt you?
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
Morning, darling.
What are they offering?
I beg your pardon?
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
We did...?
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
Courthouse back in town.
What?
They know what her tits look like.
Wat...
Whatever it is.  GO <u>do</u> it.  How you doing on the permit?
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
...they run on water.
This horse is booked.
They think it's your First Wife...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
She's a...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Get him on the...
That's my...
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
...and my heart goes out to you, because I know...
I'm only trying to...
...yes...
Marty...
I can't tell.
Doug...
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
Later for you, pal.
Mmmm.  You have children?
A witness to what...?
It burnt down.
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
No, what is it?
Then you're finished in show business.
So be it.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
I don't...
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
I...
I'm...Tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, I didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Dear, this is Mr. Rossen, he is the producer...
I want them thrown in jail.
Sherry, Sherry...
I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank of the building.  Said, "What are you doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the 'leven o'clock crossing..."
Mmm...
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
I bet.
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
I could help with the debate.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
See, I...
Honey, she won't d...
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
That's my girl...
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti.
Sugar.  I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
So where are you?
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
You say that like I don't know that.
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Rachel's not half my age.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I need practice.
Don't flatter yourself.
Luke.  Can't live like that.
...it's my problem, too.
I don't, but...
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
Beats me.  Ask your mom.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows?
Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
So I'll have to order in?
Uh.  Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
I think so too...
What's eight, ten years?  Hell, you'll still be ambulatory.  I think.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
Well, they will be.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
No, here's ugly.  'I love <u>you</u>, babe. It's just our <u>life</u> together I'm not so sure about...'
Man, I am out of here! This family is so fucked!
You know...Stanley...
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
No.
Must've been hard being poor.
I'm still poor.
Mi Jesus…mi jesus…
My Jesus…
Yes, I do. I love them!
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is serious…But don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
We're not ready.
You started filling out your college applications yet?
He's right.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
Maybe. She's OK.
Nigger.
Again!!
I hate reading.
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Toby Oxman.
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Yeah.
Well, but it was so long ago. We were so different back then...
Huh. Kids?
Three.
Thanks man.
I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies...Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Y-yes--
There isn't anyone! He's opened that whole sector now!
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
There's the fence...
Where does it lead?
She's still alive.
I'll let the senator tell you.
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Apparently, this project is--unique. But it's heavily protected--all formulas are heavily codified!
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Dissent?
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
You will not get away with this vicious attack on our peace-loving people.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
What are you talking about, Major?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Sure I do.  There was some kind of mutiny on the base, and you killed General Ripper.
Didn't they tell you?
Okay, Colonel.  But look, there's a pay phone just outside in the hall.  Maybe that works, huh?  Maybe it'll work?  What do you think?
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
What about the President?
What is your name, young lady?
What kind of trouble?
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
But...what kind of a shooting war?  Have they hit any of our cities yet?
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Who do you think you're talking to?
Yes, sir.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
Just a squirt.
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
If they gave us what we think we need, yes, I guess we would.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Lieutenant Toejam, why don't you help him?
They're moving apart.
Sure, I'll take her up to eight hundred.
Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
That's what I said.
What's your point, Lothar?
First safety.
Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit!  I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
No, I think it means, "Recall period Mistake," and the OPE is probably the CRM-114 code. Terry?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
But the CRM-114 has been smashed for almost an hour.
That's the point.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
Okay, how do we know they didn't shoot down one of our planes and torture the crew?  How do we know that?
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Are you sure?
Maybe the warning system's out.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Oh, yeah, you had to go to Highgate. That must've been intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Typical male.
It's really not about anything.
The dude wants it.
No, no.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
Okay, okay.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
Uh, last night...
No, no.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
Erica is in the van back there.
What?
She's dead?
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Hey, hey, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
This is private property, my friend.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
A reel?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
So you, like, come from a town like this or...?
Military marching bands.
Erica. So do you think you and I are alike, Erica?
Taking care of business.
Oh, sure.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Pony and I are friends.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Oh, shut up, Tim. This isn't funny, man.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
What'd you do?
I hit her.
Well, you know, all I can say is, you're a fucking fool.
The sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
Hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. Did you think she was gonna use it?
That, that's Indian?
Come on!
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Complicated or not, life moves on. Hm?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer what?
Nazeer Chaudry!
You could've come over.
Your sure as hell right about that.
About things that are important to me.
Name one.
Hey!
Yeah.
How?
No one does nothing, Jeff.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
Mm-hm.
No, I don't.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
What?
I, yeah.
Shit, Jeff!
You're unbelievable.
'Bye, Jeff.
No, it's not...
Yeah.
Yeah, I crash there.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Write. 'Cause I, I have written some things.
Well, not exactly.
You know what I'm saying?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. I'll be right back.
Camel jockey.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
Look, get down now, you fucking drunk! You bum!
Like?
New York, huh?
Yeah?
No, I'm going.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Uh, I didn't write any songs. You guys go ahead. I gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
About where she went. I mean, what bar?
Yeah.
Hey, Tim.
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Shut up, Cleo.  Di, how much do you need for an abortion?
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Oh G-d, I'm sorry... You're not really fat!  I was just saying that because, uh, I thought that's what you wanted me to say.
You sure?
Positive.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
But we agreed your job is running the baby machine...
Well, I want to know what happened --
You sure I'm not fat?
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
They could kill you.
Your help.
Let it ride for a while.
Nothing for Ladd?
I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it.
I had a teacher like that once.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Well....
Phillip, you're mad!
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
What teacher?
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
What has Artie to do with it.
What's good about it?  I miss him something fierce.
Oh, that.  It's from a friend of mine.  A middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
That's the trouble with you readers.  You know all the plots. Now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
If you please.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this.
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
Gordon Cole?
I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
We've missed you too, dear.
It's a good script, isn't it?
It's got a lot of good things.  Of course, it would be an expensive picture...
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Fair enough.
I am not afraid.  Read it!
Of course it is.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I will not have it butchered.
Hollywood.  The Alto Nido Apart- ments.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
What's that?
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set.  Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
These are nothing.  You can have anything you want if you'll only stay.  What is it you want -- money?
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
Dressed for what?
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
The doctor suggested it.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Softball.
Eliminate her.
That's easy for you to say, Bianca.
The Naming of Names is not necessary. Just concentrate on her face. Your Shadow will do the rest.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Let me out. I have to talk to you.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
Come on, let's ride.
We're from different worlds.
What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
But why?
I sort of like what you said.
In this big old house on Orchard Avenue---but you better stay away from there.
Turn it against her.
I did.
I bet they do.
What an adorable hat.
Why should I believe you?
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
I can't help it if men notice me.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
I allowed it to escape the City.
This is all your clothes?
Oh wow, I should've known. Me and my big mouth. Listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. Any time.
Must've been a defective puck.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
No, no. Not lovely. 'Perfect'. Did everything just right. Nobody telling you to change this, move that around. Please yourself. That's the secret of happiness.
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Zaltar!
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
Tuesday.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
The streamers? They're no problem, you just pull on them and --
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
I thought "Clark Kent has a really nice voice." You didn't even know I was there.
No, thanks.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
We get together sometimes.
I wouldn't know Mr. Kent. Most of the people I went to high school with are still in high school.
What about this week's check?

Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Which country?
Columbia.
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
Greed!  Let me tell you something---
What do you want?
Exactly. Stoned mother.
That's up to the judge, Gus. It's not your problem anymore.
We gonna crash?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
No...I just have a little stop to make.
And do what?
It was hot!
Whoopee.
I just knew I was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
In other words, push this red button.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
Somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the Aerospace Center and reach Vulcan.
Well, Webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. How about...hmmmm, someplace small...
What's wrong?
I just remembered the rest. There isn't any more. The only chunk that ever landed on Earth disappeared a couple of years ago. It was in this story in the Daily Planet.
The planet Superman came from. Krypton.
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Maybe I could try --
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
What??
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Oh, hi.
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
Does Lois know about this yet?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
I'll be alright.
It's beautiful.
North.
What do you want?
Australia.
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Free!
Don't worry, I've got you.
I'm not avoiding you. I've been very busy and . . . I like you . . . I really do.
I'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. It's very chic.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And this so-called . . . Nuclear Man. . . of yours can defeat Superman?
Do people die in Italian Operas? Gentlemen, if all goes to plan Nuclear Man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce Superman's skin. He'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
I'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. I promise you. For it is they , and not I, that represent the people of Earth.
But he's never there.
Our other dinner guest.
If you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the Nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
Lucky I brought my drums.
You are . . .
Shut up, apple-polisher.
Lois isn't here?
I think I lost a week's salary at the dart board.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Come again?
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
You're just jealous.
Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Neither my wife nor I will attempt to leave Krypton.
He sure as heck does that.
Lara, please...
Their atmosphere will sustain him. He will look like one of them.
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
195 pounds.
What about it?
Pink.
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
I guess I...uh...regressed.
You mean bullets and fire and all that can't hurt him, but this kind of rock --
Of time, Luthor.
The XK 101. Luthor, that operates on radio waves. And with our fail-safe system, only the President himself can push that button.
They'll soon be over.
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
She's in trouble?
Was it good?
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
How?
I better get back.
Good night.
Why?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
Berry-picking.
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
The Walkers loved Sean.  He was their only child...the object of all their attention.  I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man.  That's his nature.  But Risa, she's still got dreams.
That would complicate things.
Billy Ansel will insist that you were driving fifty-one miles an hour.  Just like you've done every morning for the past fifteen years.
Yes.  He does.
Yes.  Abbot understands these things.
Oh, it's bizarre alright.  C'mon Bear.  Let's get you out of here.
And winter?
It's the truth.
No.
What's a ditty again?
Oh.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back?  To wave at your Dad?
Okay.
There's the Prescots...
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.
No.
Any criminal record?
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
No.
Mrs.  Ansel's clothing.
As opposed to this T.V.?
I don't know.
Will the police do anything to her?
She'll move away.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
A Senator, an Agent and Something - With - Long - Red - Hair.
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
I'm afraid I can't cope with them.
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
I said Sidney!...
Can I come in for a minute?
I didn't say that, J.J.
Are you finished?
Not "we", Sidney, you!
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
- He's got them on him.
Well, I'll be darned.  And what does J.J. think he SHOULD do?
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
He was writing a special Sunday piece on...?
What sort of thing?
This sort of thing!
Listen, you need him for a favor, don't you!  And so do I!  I need his column--tonight.  Didn't you ask me to do something about your job?  Don't you have a kid in Military School?
- that's what I mean!
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
The renting agent and the tailor.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
And leave a tip in every hat-check room in town?
Nothing...
Cheers.  What time is it, Al?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Frankly, yes, to my surprise.  He thinks he's very gifted - those boys'll go a big mile, he thinks.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
I didn't do anything!
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I was scary stuff, radically advanced.  It was shattered... didn't work.  But it gave us ideas, It took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  All this work is based on it.
We have to leave the city, immediately.  And avoid the authorities.
Can I stop by my house?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Just say "I swear I won't kill anyone."
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
No.  I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  Then it doesn't matter.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
Remember what I said, you can't...
I have to go away, John.
No!  Don't kill him!
I love you, John.  I always have.
And what it that?
Unknown.
Why him?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
On Furtwängler.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
And this, only one of these letters, Major. I have lots of them.
Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you.
'Dim-shits'?
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
Yes. What was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for Hitler's birthday?
Yeah.
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
That's why he didn't get the hell out of here when he had the chance! I put that to him, he couldn't answer. Why didn't he go and direct in America, like that Italian, Toscanini.
Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
That is correct.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
Who?
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
You sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, God in heaven, did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me? The greatest conductor on earth. I want him out the way. He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music. Send him to Stalingrad. Isn't that what you did? You don't like criticism, do you, Wilhelm?  You surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... Are you saying the name von der Null was never mentioned in your talks with Goebbels?
And what happened to Von der Nul?
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Of course there was a conspiracy against me, a campaign - even abroad.
Of course I know what that is.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
What?
He did?
Who's he?
Sure.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
You're late.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Just what you see, pal.
Don't wear the beige one.
Right.
Kyle.
John never said much about him.  He dies.  Even before the war...
That's the way it was told to me.
That's not my mission.
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
It'll never be over, will it? Look at me, I'm shaking. Some legend, huh?  You must be pretty disappointed.
Good fighters.
Can't.  Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through. It's just him and me.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
Call her again.
Admittedly...
It probably will.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  Why should I settle for that?
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
Clean out your locker.
I said I was sorry...
Hold on...  They want your driver's license number.
I'm sorry, about this...
Never mind.
You pull me up.
Consumer Recreation Services.  It's their building.  They...
You're the one who started running.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I think not.
Don't.  It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
Keep it.
God, wake up, it's a con!
I could've handed you to them.  They find me now, I'm dead...
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
They did the same to him as they did to you.
... what... ?
That gun.  That... that's not automatic.  The guard had an automatic...
Fuck you.
No, now wait... think about it.  What did you see... ?
I saw them kill him!
Let me show you...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
I realize.  Maybe you could... tell me a little about yourself.
Like... where are you from?
Julliard, yeah.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
Nowhere in particular.  Don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
This isn't an escort service?
It's a profound life experience.
Why would you say that?
It doesn't matter...
Do it for YOU.
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
You're part of it...
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Split it?
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
It always is.
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
You need to fill out those forms. Application, psych-tests: M.M.P.I. and T.A.T.  For the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  We'll run a T.R.W....
What's all this for?
We provide whatever's lacking.
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
Hey, everyone -- snack time!  Here... here you go...
It was a different floor then...
Guess!
Hm?
Not much, I think.
You're here for Conrad Van Orton? I'm the hotel manager...
Look, where is he?!
No.
No.
What?
What gentleman, Maria?
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
I don't know what you're talking about.  I'm just driving...
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
It's what they do.  It's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  Depraved children.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
<u>Every</u> year is a good year.
Uh... Nell Vance...
Come on.  These are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
No.
-- how much is this car worth?
Where in the hell can she be.
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
I, I just can't...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
I have a bad feeling about what you're doing.
But there's a sad catch to the story.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
No.  If he's lost somewhere in the house... he'll have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  What we have to do now is be together, with Nell.
Why'd she kill herself?
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
I don't know what you mean.
That's why we're here.
No.  The world has missed you.
I don't know what to think anymore.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I used to hate it.  Now I like it.
It's not a knock.
It's not a compliment.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Like you.
Oh, god.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
What shit is this.  I just do it.  I don't prepare it.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
This is un-fucking professional.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
You think I'm staying?
Fuck you.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit.
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
One thing I need.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
You just cooking then?
No, but I know what he means.
Perhaps it was the smoke.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
It's been a while.
Try calling me again.
I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  It must've been the bars.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
What's that, like a P.O. box.
There's the phone.  You want his number.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
You ever been to London?
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Poor baby.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
All of what?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
Unless I'm not who I think I am.
Could do, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
What d'you mean, any happier?
What?
I happen to know more about Mr. Whatever- his-name-is than he thinks I know about him and his operation.
You do?
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
I doubt it.
What are you doing here?
I don't want you here, Terry.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Yeah. Thanks.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...Uh-huh.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
No. Uh... family friend.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Sure.
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I'll have it in a week.
Way out of line.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
...You know... who *who* is?
OK.
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
My wife and I had not... performed the sex act in many years.
Mm.
--don't interrupt me--that's Means. They got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
How did you get into the store?
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. Absolutely worthless.
Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
Barber, right? I'm Freddy Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell me the chow's OK here. I made some inquiries.
No thanks, I--
We're just closing, friend.
Sure. Can Ed come too?
Second chair.
Not an owner.
You'll go to the prison hospital.
I'm sorry, sir.  You okay?
Anything missin'?
No one broke into this room, sir. Someone broke out.  That lock was torn off from the <u>inside</u>.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
You said the system couldn't fail!
Where's the head?
Whose footprints?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
This door's locked.  Try shooting the hinges off.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
May I see that?
What's that doing here?
I hope you liked it.
A blow dart.  Seed pods.  A plant press.  Pretty unimpressive stuff.
But a virus normally codes for other viruses.  This one's making human and animal proteins.  Listen to this.  "Glycotetraglycine collagenoid. Weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Look who's here, Margo.
How many storage areas are there?
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
I don't believe it.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Keep the animal quiet.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Okay.
The people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  Just like Beauregard.  One part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  The hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
Behind me.  Over there.
They're all heavily armed.
What was it?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Wounded?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
It's scared of me.
For what?
I think... for the pleasure of the kill.
How?
That thing is John Whittlesley.  I should have seen it before!  The fibers are infected with a virus. You eat them, and the virus alters your DNA!  He became addicted to them in South America, followed the plants back to the states.  He probably entered the country as a man.  It would have taken several months for the change to take place. That's how he got from the boat to the museum!
I thought you were in a hurry.
That's right.
Do it!
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Amnesia.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
No, of course not.  And since the show runs 24 hours a day with no commercial breaks the staggering profits are all generated from product placement.
There's nothing on the show I don't use myself.
Shhh!
You think she'd go through with it?
No.
I...I can't.
I can't tonight.
No.
Truman?  It's me, Marlon.  I need to talk to you.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
--Darling--
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
They're going to stop me talking to you.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Yeah.
Yes.
Strughold. He's just gotten on a plane in Tunis.
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
He just let it explode.
Before the bomb went off?
Are you saying it wasn't such a small outbreak?
A plague?
The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
I'm not sure. A virus --
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
I think they have that covered.
Oh yeah. Had you big time.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
Why?
They were the ones that put us together.
You're... quitting?
I thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
Just get dressed. I'll explain on the way.
According to this tag.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
-- of what exactly?!
I don't believe this. I don't fucking believe this.  Y'know, I've been here... I've been here one too many times with you, Mulder.
Not unless those are giant Jiffy Pop containers out there.
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
Yeah...?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
Well, call General McAddie.
I don't have his number.
-- They're asking her for a narrative. They want to know why she was in the wrong building.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
Dr. Kurtzweil is in the trunk.
How?
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
This isn't Colonization, it's spontaneous repopulation. All our work... if it's true, then they've been using us all along. We've been laboring under a lie!
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Someday you can.  We all believe that...
Yes mother.
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
You don't know the procedure.
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Okay, okay...
That hoist, with the winch...
They took care of that, thank you, Henry. 
Absolutely.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
You're looking well.
Completely unaware.
Anne Vicksey didn't own a dog.
They're in that fucking thing for forty hours, Gordon.  Four-oh.  He got Julia at seven-thirty last night.  You know what time it is now...?!
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
I don't have to.
Sayen sie ed our den Leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
He was Harry's driver?
I know. I wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
"Ein hurigan" - I guess.
Tell me more.
He liked to laugh.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
His.
It wasn't important.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Where?
Just around the corner.
This is forgery. It is very clever.
Been here long?
What?
It wasn't petrol.
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
No.
Win what?
I haven't got a sensible name, Calloway.
Well, look, is there a car here I can use?
Who?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
Listen...
Talk to me?...Of course...Come on...
She's been arrested.
Coffee.
But you will.
Yes.
Coming to the point, please.
In great pain?
Not necessarily.
Mr. Lime - yes.
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Yes.
Of course there was. Some ice for Mr. Martins.
What else?
He didn't want to get involved.
That Harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
Joseph Harbin? No...no.
Yes.
His name?
Yes?
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
There is one problem.
One or two kilometers.
So?
I think we're about half way.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
What happened?
You can swim?
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
So there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. It's about a beach.
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Killing himself.
Why won't you talk to me?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
That's stupid.
Where are they?
The sex is better.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
You think I should just because there's no reason?
You don't own this place.
I didn't realize you cared.
Why don't you come visit, we'll have a rematch.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
You ever fuck a Jewish girl?
What??!?
Notice? Like what...?
The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Give me a reason not to.
Get the fuck away from me.
How did you...?
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
You do it on the inside....
What is happening?
I've got to get back to the --
Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the <i>New York Times</i>.
Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs.  A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause.
What...?
Mrs. Moebius.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
Leary?
Just a little... What's the difference?
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES....
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
No!
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
I might have known.  As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
How many are, down there?
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
"That"!  This is not a "that"...
You're the best, Enzo!
What room have you got?
Yes.
Oh it's nothing.  I knew it.  I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good".  I lost my title but I won a watch!
Well that's very nice of you.
I don't know, I just feel it.
I did?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Johana... New York.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
In the spring when he melts!
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Yeah, no kidding.
I want you to talk dirty to me.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
...So you saved Hanukkah Mr. Big Shot. I mean, let's be honest Mordechai, it isn't even one of the high holidays.
I'll be in my office.
Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode.
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
He's still working out some identity issues.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Take a look.
The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive.
I'm just calming the kiddies.  There's no need to worry about Santa. He's just having a peaceful, adult conversation with his nice Jewish friend, The Hebrew Hammer.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about.
Resting?
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
No, he wasn't kidding. I'm sick. Claw women? Hurt little girls? No!
What do you want to see him for?
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
What are you doing that for?
Go on -—
Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
I want to ask you something.
That's right, of course.
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
More or less.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
I don't know.
Just barely possible - - yes.
Tell me.
That was a calamity!
Thanks, Sheriff.
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
No —- not yet.
What did he have to do -— look at the body?
And did you find the leopard?
Forget it. I'm buying a drink for a fellow who was on the posse with me, a nice guy. Come along he'll get a great kick out of meeting you.
Absolutely sure.
How do you know?
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
That might depend on where you’re going.
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Disney! How inter...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
You’re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He’s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
Leon hung himself...
Leon hung himself...
Is there anything to understand?
Simplify and damn.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
You wouldn’t understand.
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Emily...
We also provide 24-hour after-sale service. Were the puppy to fall sick or accidently die, we would unburden you, you understand?
What about an untrained pup, white...
How much of a hurry are you in?
I see. How much?
...On holiday?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Where?
Where are we?
The company. We all work for the company.
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Should I?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his. 
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
Didn’t you say I came recommended?  That’s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Huh, I doubt it...  Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Huh... I’m sure there’d be lots of takers.
I told you... The rabble, it’s me...  Huh... It’s sad.
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - you’re the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
No. I meant he left as in no longer works here.
Oh. This is... We’d arranged to meet tonight and I’m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Should I be?
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Good reasons?
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Excuse me?
Would you know where I might reach her?
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pré- pubescents.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Let me give you a tip, asshole - no one pulls stunts like what you pulled in London and here tonight and hopes to get away with it. It upsets people. It’s wrong. Fucking wrong.
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
It appears that in their younger days they were actively involved with a shady German group of Nazi hunters known as “Never Forget”. Over the years we’re talking about a dozen or so execution-type killings.
Are they still operative?
Costliest!
What’s that? A word?
What do you think?
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
I thought you were an archer?
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
Come with me...
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
But it is what I want.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
That's an order!
One day you will.
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
Why?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
And when was that?
To hell with procedure!  We paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
God defeated the English, not me.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
Thanks be to God.
I... I can't stop her.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
Because... because -- I mean -- the English have a broad sense of humor, but... I mean, you don't understand... to them you're a witch, working for the devil.  What makes you think they'll listen to you?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
God.
The English won't wait.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Jeanne, look behind you.
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Here -- take this instead.
It's not possible...
My king.
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define.  When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
But you already confessed this morning...
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Yes, it is.
Who is this "he"?
What... does he... look like?
And what does he say to you?
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
Only God knows the answer to that.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I want to be at one with Him now.
I came specially to meet you today. I love your playing, but what a day to choose.
My name's Dorota, I'm Jurek's sister. oh! You're bleeding.
Michal Dzikiewicz. He's my husband.
He'll be here soon.
Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
Calm down, what, what is it?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
You'll be deported.
Yes, but what good did it do?
So, what's the news?
The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov.
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
I was listening, Kitten.
In the attic.
Not yet.
... without a shred of manners.
Like it were a piano?
No, it was a table.
Certainly, there is nothing so easy to like as a pet and they are quite silent.
Ohh the tag is broken.
And where did they get married?
The Alps.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
I'd like to make a swap.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ...  Teach him to look after it.
You've missed this bit.
She never gives him a turn.
What will I play?
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
All right if I look around your lobby?
No, but you're welcome to a free beer before you go.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
Hell no, I just cut into him.  I woulda settled for pawning one of them shoes.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
All of it.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Which way did he do, Eirie?
The bastard.  He can blow his nose all the way.
There's always a depression on.
If you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
Forget it.
Which one?
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
What do ya want the others to get?
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
Lonnegan after you, too?
You're sacred of 'em, aren't ya?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You wanta wait for your share?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
Lonnegan.
See ya and raise three.
Raise 5,000.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
Gondorff asked me to look after ya.
How do I know you're tellin' the truth.
Don't have much choice, do ya?
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
But I got a train to make.
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
You doin' anything tonight?
I thought it might be good for him to see the setup.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
He cheats.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Get on with it then.
Had a little fight with a raggle down on 13th.  She got me with her ring.
No.
Hell yes.  We don't care about the mark.  He deserves what he gets.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
You weren't hired to miss him.
There wasn't any way he coulda known we was in there.  We made a clean pick on the lock and didn't leave no footprints in the hall. Somebody musta wised him up.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Is that what it means?
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
He's just around the corner.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Darling, you can't go through any more of this.  Now you get together your clothes and your skates and we'll go out to my family's in the country.
I can't.
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
Probably not.
Yes.  Some nut who wanted to kill him.  How is your father?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Oh, thank heaven.
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
He's been dead for three months.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
And he still wants to marry me!
Only in bad weather.
But it isn't bad weather now.
That woman!
Gilbert!
We were looking for this bird.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
No.
What about Jorgensen?
No.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
He did!
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
Chris!
I thought you said you weren't going there.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
No word at all?
Slim.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Who is she?
We need ice.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with.  Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
Good. I want to talk to you.
Maybe it would if I took it.
I'd like to see you work.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Is that another Christmas present?
You talk as if I were Asta.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
I'll be all right.  I've got Asta to protect me.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
You bet I wouldn't.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Huh?
Couple of months anyway.
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Yes.
No, Mr. Charles.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
I wouldn't know.  That time he caught me was a accident.  I led with my right.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
Bonds, sir?
Baghdad.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
No, please, not again.
We can fight.  That's what we're here for:  To fight the Iraqis.  To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
He tried to kill us.  If not just now, then in the helicopter.  That's all the authority I need.
It's a combat action.
What are you doing?
I'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
It's not about being fun.  It's about being smart.  You take that money, you take care of it, let it grow, and you don't ever have to do anything again. Ever.  That's freedom.  That's what I'm talking about.
TAKE THE GODDAMN BINOCULARS!
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
Yeah.  I know.  I'm with you.
Mine.
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
What does it look like I'm doing?
Get up and dig.
He's not going to leave us.
We'll find our way.
Wes is dead!
They'll search the pack.
That helicopter passes, and the only thing we're close to is death.
Yeah.  Well, me too.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
I never had anything before, Epps.  I never was anybody.  Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins.  When I was in high school I used to--
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Don't you touch it.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
I don't know.  They killed Wes.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
Maybe...maybe if we traded them the gold. If we gave it to them they might let us live; they might not kill us.
This whole time, you've kept your head. You didn't go money simple like me and Wes.  You've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here.  And you've been fair too.  I mean, even after I...you know...
I could use some recon photos too.
Just...want to be ready when we do.
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
What?
That's in two days.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
You know what, Wes?  If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to.  And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
Two vehicles.  They're not supposed to be here.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Violation?
Correct.  Now secure a sinex drop reading.
Vocasity
Eat your dinner.
Don't go.
That's not dirt...Can't be dirt.. Dirt is a violation.
I don't want to lose you.
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
A shelldweller.  They live in the outer shell of the city.  Quite unique, there have been two here before.  They smell.
Impossible!
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
On the contrary!  It absolutely proves what I have always felt. We are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  We are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  We must continue the search.
Maternity ward, huhh!
No!....
I'm only trying to help you.
I did not accept any.  I...  I wanted... to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Just do it.
Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
Where...?
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Take a tip from the Bomb Boys, always assess, if only for a second.
How do you know?
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Right.
Which one's which?
Oh shit...
Thank you.
Stay here.
Stay in the truck.
Reilly, what're you doing here?
What kind of bomb was it?
Fuck factor ten.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
Quiet!
Captain assigned me to assist you.
You mean you just--? ... You keep a record of... matches?
That feeling won't last long.
Report on the case so far.
But from now on, any leads on this case go to Pluchinsky. He's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the Bomb Squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. Got it?
It's our only option.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
And diamonds in the front.
Well, have you found it?
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
About tonsils.
Yes!
Now see here, my good man. I've had just about enough of your insulting remarks!
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
I thought so.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And, waiter--you see that moon?
Yes, Baron?
I don't want to see you at all!
Um-hum ...
Um-hum!
I've got to see you.
You say I am a crook.
Good day, Doctor.
The tennis player?
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
No--no.
I would like to.
You're very welcome.  Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief.  The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket.  In fact, you tickled me.  But your embrace was so sweet ... 
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out <u>with</u> the Bank of Constantinople?
Gaston!
Right.
What?
But it's not enough!
Certainly!
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Lily-- 
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
Well--I am Madame Colet.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
Too much blue in crimson.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
As you like. 
Beautiful specimen.
Isn't that wonderful!  You see, madame-- 
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
On the night table.
Instantly.
Adolph J. Giron.
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
It could have been marvelous ...
But it could have been glorious.
Yes, Madame Colet?
To M'sieu Laval?
About what?
To me he seems rather nervous.
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Right!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Yes, my bag!
But you saw it here.
Thank you, Rose.
You're certain?
Don't you mean work me?
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I was tired.
I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.  Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?
Excuse me.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
I see you.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
You're right. Only you can do that.
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
How'd you ever get away with it?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
I can explain--
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Oh--a hundred times--
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Sure!  Excuse me.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
So you washed it off!
Married?
Tell me.
Don't be a c-a-t.
I'll be there--Good-by.
Sorry.
Sally--!
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Make it five.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Now you're talkin'!
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
I wouldn't be surprised--
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap? 
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Sure.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
I can see you're no gentleman--
Not the <U>real</U> Chad Denby?--
<U>Nuts</U> to you too!
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Yes!
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Well, he has a straw hat--
No--but I'm going to keep my eye on--
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
No!
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Because I was yellow, I guess--
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst.  Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call.  Cover your ears, darling.
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
I don't understand.
Oh, Jesus, Johnny...
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Here it come: one-two-
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
That's all right, Doc.  Don't worry.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
What?  But I saw 'em-
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
Damn!  All right, wait a minute...
Cards in spades.  I'm in love with Every second of her life.  Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Easy to fix.  Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Wait!
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
No really, I can stay a while.
Out ridin'.  So... how you doin'?
Isn't there anything I can say That'll change your mind?  You're Gonna stay with your new friends?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Not anymore, not after this.
All right, run 'em off.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Fine.  Better.
I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
You'll never make that stick.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Curly Bill, huh?  Who was that Other idiot?
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
And I have the entire British economy to worry about.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
I see.
- Instant melt-down.
I'm sorry.
Him? He, is a she -  at the bar.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Political considerations?
Well... If you insist.
Does it work on cash machines?
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Pity.  Bring him whatever he wants.
And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
No?
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
He was my father's best friend!
And number two?
I understand.
We serve the interests of the British people, 007. No matter who we may be foolish enough to elect.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Remind me.
Tsi tien, Professor Wu.
I was an attorney!
Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
I see you two have met.
- I told you! He was there! -
Good. We have an appointment in Hong Kong.
I should have hired this man.  Get somebody up there!
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
Junior spends time with his child.
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You all act like two roosters.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
All those places that us coloreds lived, that we used to call Bottoms, have all been changed to Drives and Heights. Everything is in what you call it, not in what it is.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
I made a fresh pot of coffee. Okra and I thought you need a rest. I'll stand guard. Okra wants to talk to you anyway.
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
Those boys never did have good luck.
That's nice.
No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
Where is Skip?
Okay.
Okay...
Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
Here!  In the car!
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Excuse me, I think the word you're searching for is Space Ranger.
Excuse me.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Where?
WHAT?!!  What are you talking about?!
Don't tell me what to do!
Out the window...Buzz, you're a genius!
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
Heh-heh.
Are you peeking?
I dunno.
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
You are a liar!
But what if Andy gets another dinosaur?  A mean one?  I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection.
Hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  This is Andy we're talking about.
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
I thought he was at summer camp!
Uh-oh.

Slink!  Hang on!
I like plaits.
Slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. Don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
I can't go home because there's no home left.
You're only a young thing.
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Did you now.
All the time.
Everything is gone, now.
Victoria -
What? Did you let that child play with one of my toys? I don't like children playing with my toys.  Have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. Give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
It's all right, Finn.
I don't know what you mean.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
He never came home last night.  Was he with you?
How much do I pay him?
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
So my wife is lying?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
This is different.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Yeah, because the alternative is to be bored to death.
Caroline --
You can't make me.
Oh, yes I can.
Live with your parents?
He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
I'm telling you, she doesn't know shit.
Depends on the state.
Not Tiger Woods.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
It's a death sentence.  I'll never make it to the trial.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Exactly, and this is how I know I'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government.
Go home.  Get cleaned up.  Get to work.  Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I'm not getting left behind.  Don't fuck this up.
An informant.
Only if he can be trusted.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I have money --
Oh, man --
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
He's a research doctor.  You're dad's a doctor, too --
What kind of research?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
No. On you go.
Well, I've not brought them.
Shag her senseless.
But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
I guess you would, Franco.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Out.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
So long as everyone keeps their mouths shut, we'll not be getting caught.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
And you might get the fucking job.
My problem is that I tend to clam up. I go dumb and I can't answer any questions at all. Nerves on the big occasion, like a footballer.
You don't know, do you?
What do you mean?
Right. So we all get old and then we can't hack it any more. Is that it?
What's wrong, Allison?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
But you don't have the money?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
Six weeks.
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Pavel.
DO it. Go to Red Alert.
I don't have a clue.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
What is it you seek?
Have faith, my friend. There are more of us than you know.
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Put it on the screen.
Spock, I appreciate your concern, but if you don't stop distracting me, I'm liable to be one...
I've always known... I'll die alone.
I am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
Are we leaving, Captain?
Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Yes, Captain.
But he does seem familiar?
Damn.  Let's go.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
There, you see? See?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
Fire the rockets!
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.


"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. I am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. Since that time I have found myself and my place. I know who I am. And I cannot go with you.
This is my doing. This is my arrogance... my vanity...
Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
And Dillinger's instructions to divert them -- it's all there - look, even his home phone number, when he logged on.
Frustrating. I had Tron almost ready to run, and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system.
Of what?
I hope you don't think it's me. I don't even balance my checkbook on downtime.  I've got a Honeywell at home for that.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Right on the money!
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
So do as I tell you. Keep that Tron program out of the system. And get me those Chinese language program I asked for.
Doing our business is what computers are for. Look, Walter, with all respect -- ICOM isn't the business you started in your garage anymore --
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Greetings, program...
How about you?
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Sure, a little disorientation. That's normal, when they transport you. It'll come back to you. You're doing real well in training. Remarkable, really...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Well, just don't forget your old friends when you're rich and famous.
We might be capturing some military programs soon... that interest you?
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
End of line.
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
The Users...you really think they're still there?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
It is true!  He doesn't know anything about me.  He still thinks I'm like ten years old or something.  As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  But it's not fine.  Nothing's fine.
Where are you off to young lady?
Yeah, right.
She lives in Rome, but she does stuff here the Smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
What?
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Will you just open the door!					*
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Yeah, but for who?							*
What are you talking about?
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Yes what?
Me too.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
Yeah.  I suppose he is.
And you agreed?
Do you still love your husband?
I love him.  I have always loved him and I will always love him.  Can I go home, please?
I think so.
Dance?
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Worse than Cairo?							*
It's serious.  That's all I can				* say.  Just meet on K Street under				* the Key Bridge.  At eight sharp.				*
What is it you need me to do?
Relax.  There, that's better. Let yourself slip into the role.
Helen.
Find out who this Renquist it.
He wants to speak with you.
This is great, we got cable.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The letter he sent.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Thanks a lot.
I took a cab.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
There's nothing to tell.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
Thank you.
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
I just gotta get somethin'.
Why?
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
That rhymes.
You'd really do that?
I don't blame you.
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
I'm her husband.
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Really?
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
How 'bout me what?
Yeah?
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
Me too, Boris.
I bullshitted him.
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
No shit?
No.
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go?
Uh-huh.
What about him?
Thank you.
Absolutely.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.
What can I do?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Naw, he ain't home right now.
Sorta room-mates?
Do you know where we can find him?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
And your only goal is...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
Do you know why you're here, James.
A jail?  Prison?
What's wonderful about the air, James?
This is April, right?
What?
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
Everybody's got a gun.  In this city...
Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
Jeffrey Mason?
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
You disappeared!  One minute you were there, the next minute you were gone. Did you run through the woods?
I don't know -- I don't remember.
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
You said I had delusions -- that I created a world -- you said you could explain everything...
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
So you could talk to these scientists and they do what?  Send you to the future?
What's that mean?
You know -- your plan.
Yes, sir.
I didn't think I was being defensive. I was just...
That woman is...was...your... psychiatrist?  And now she's spray- painting our building?
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
No and I don't plan on sticking around either.  I don't guess I'll be seeing you again.  Take it easy.
That's my morning's pay.
How much.
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
Sweet talk me all you want, I still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Yeah, but it was shot.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
Yes.  Yes it is.
Wrong number.
I picked them out for you, Jake.  I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
I'm just going to my car.
I don't know your real name.
I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't.  I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out.
I didn't say it bothered me.
A medicine man?
Come here.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Have you ever been there before?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Jake.
You live pretty good.
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I wanted to talk.
Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
Because I know you're full of shit.
We're going all the way.  Together.
Not me.  Us.
He was going to--
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Grace!
I'm here.
I'll get it.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Fuck you!  Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you!  John . . . John!?
Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
I've got to make a stop in Vegas, then I'm heading to Santa Barbara.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy you that.  Beside, I can hardly blame you.  That Grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she? Eh?
Like you don't know.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
About what you said this morning.
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
I need thirteen.
That's a bit much.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
What should I do?
Is the job done?
You didn't kill her?
Drop it, Jake.
And next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
That's what I like about you, Jake. You're an honest man.
No.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
You thought you'd come in here in the middle of the night and wham! Wail off and clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
Two-hundred dollars.
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of.
Got any requests?
Oz.
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
What's your name anyway?
Get away from me!
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
Oh, shit!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
No police!
Christ no!
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
All right, old man.  Christ.
That's 'cause he's dead.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
That a fact?
What?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
You know I won't be seeing you.
Make time?  Is everybody in this town on drugs?
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town.  She needed a hand with her drapes.  That's all.
It ain't broke.
That's a solid name.
Live there?
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples.
Would you kill her?
I did?
You're talking like a madman.
I need thirteen.
How do you want it?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
You came to take my wife from me?
Two-hundred dollars?
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Nope.  Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
You own this place?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Great!
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
I'm just going to my car?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You sure you can manage?
All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas.
You've been around.
Where you headed?
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Try me.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch.
Good thinking.  What's all this?
We're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
<u>I don't know why</u>!
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
Mexico is a large country. Where in Mexico would you like--
One way, or round trip?
No! No! Please!
Oh.
What about Jeb?
What does that mean?
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
out again?
As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood?
Skeptical about what?
You've misunderstood.
I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants.  Like on t.v.
It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
He's kind of a miracle.
He's got the most beautiful eyes... The hell kind of question is that? He's a guy.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
What things?
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
Okay.
How so?
No?
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Like whores?
Thank God.
I wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Oh. How long I been here?
Three days? I must be.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
Yeah. See?
Well, I was always tasting the soup two hours after I et it.
Oh yeah.
Alive?
Those cowboys messin' him up?
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Shit, Skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
I... dunno. I mean, I guess not. No, they ain't carryin' no guns.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
What for?
Well... you don't look so prosperous. Hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. We could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
If you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due West to the Western Trail an' North to Ogallala.
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
Yup.
First one what?
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
Huh?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
You ain't like that no more.
Beats the hell out of me.
I didn't see nothin' planted.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
Worms was comin' out.
Easy, Bill.
No... I meant...
I seen two fellas followin' me, I guessed they come to kill me.  We didn't talk about no other fella.
Yeah?
Fuck you.
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
An' if I spot 'em?
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
Umm ...
RIGHT THERE. FREEZE.
They fucking know everything.
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
Dig.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
If I'm going in, I want a stake.
Fenster and Hockney?
No killing?
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Waste of time.
You know damn well what I think.
Kobayashi.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A.?
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
And this is why you never told the D.A.
What happened?
I never heard of him.
Keaton was Keyser Soze
I knew him. He would never -
It was all Keaton. We followed him from the beginning.
You think he's..?
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
Nothing.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
What is the truth?
That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took her life, she's in a coma, her life is gone.  She has no family, she has no home, she's tied to a machine, she has no friends --and the people who should care for her:  her Doctors, and you, and me, have been bought off to look the other way.  We have been paid to look the other way.  I came in here to take your money.   I brought snapshots to show you. So I could get your money.   I can't take it.  If I take it. If I take that money I'm lost. I'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser.    I can't do it. I can't take it.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Tell me one?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
I know of him.
You may step down.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
It's completely done on a contingency basis.  That means whatever the settlement is I retain one-third ...that is, of course, the usual arrangement ...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
'Code Blue'...
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Right.  Who called?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Well, maybe you better do that, then.   You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores.  You'd do anything for a dollar.  You got no loyalty...no nothing...you're a bunch of whores.
I'm sure it is, Frank:  and let me tell you something.  If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?   See my point?  Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket.  You follow me?  I'm trying to help you.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Ready, your Honor.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Exception!
Noted.  Thank you.   Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness.  Her sole rebuttal was the document,  which has been disallowed...
What Hotel are you staying at?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
That's what I'm going to try to do.
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
What happened...?
You do what you want.  You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You, you don't under...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
What the hell do you think you're doing ...?  What's going on here ...?
What?
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
No.
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
...one of the other nurses?
What did she do?
The Hospital...?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
I don't know.
... I understand ...
You saw Kat in New York...   ...or is she in town? Is she in town...?
Four.  You're great with these kids.
Who told you that?
Mrs...
Yes.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
Yes, that's correct.
What happened in those three...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
Ah? That complicates the problem.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
Almost a year.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
How often does this happen?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
Nothing.
What happened?
She... went into the Bay.
You.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Tomorrow night? Well --
That's not very complimentary, either.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
No, it's all right.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
Shopping?
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
The oldest living things?
Why did you jump?
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
No!
Yes --
Please let me go.
Why?
What is her name?
Oh, no! She hasn't been here at all! I would have seen her, you know. I've been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
What car?
Ah, Johnny-O...
Oh!
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Three whole weeks.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
How?
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
You haven't told me everything.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
How?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
Name one.
You never were a team player. That's why you never had any friends.
I have plenty of friends.
What?
Calling the ambulance.
No, I mean the suitcases. We can't bury them in suticases.
That is absolutely not true.
What does that mean?
Any time fat boy!
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
Don't eyeball your kids.
Y'see? That's the real point here. That's what I'm driving for, when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave's are bare. What's left? The little trees, the little fellas that the storm didn't see. The tiny little...
I don't think so.
That's the whole point. They rarely work out. But on occasion they do. And when they do, they do big.
Left side.
So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them.  Surrender is no longer an option. I repeat - It is not an option. Is there anyone who does not understand that?
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
What does that mean?
I don't know...
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Okay fine.
Oh really? Starbucks?
Israel doesn't have a King.
You said nobody would miss her.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
Goosed!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Are we supposed to?
You forgot the tent?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's a moron.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
What are you talking about?
Who else?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
What kind of seats can we have?
Not padded ones.
Go down where?
I'll call them from the road.
Just call and let me know that your okay.
Well I do.
Hey. It's me.
We're on our way home. I just...we're running a little late.
What okay?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
No way.
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
I know.
Do you love me?
What kind of stupid question is that?
No Micheal did. It was an accident.
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
I'm just so scared of that song. That fucking, "My son just arrived the other day...he says thanks for the ball, come on let's play. I got lots of bills come again next day. He's grown up just like me...My boy is just like me." Gordon fucking Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever, that song just fucking kills me.
Just kills me...
Well, I'm in the middle of my Goddamn toast here.
I just want her to be happy.
Buzzing?
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Yup.
What song?
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The post-Vegas Man.
Okay boys, smile!
You'd like me to kill them?
Two.
Then it's a respectable house.
Only because you want it.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
He was asking for it.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
You wouldn't be here otherwise.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Well... is it so urgent?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
How much do you want for him?
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Don't say that.
Right, I won't say that, but I still think they're no use.
A black bull!
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Have I slept long?
I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program.
Why wasn't I told?
But only you will know he's not human.
I wish we could hear them.
Donley started experiencing the attack for real. If I hadn't gotten you out, the same thing would have happened to you.  You may not believe this, Parker,
What about them?
It's too early in the morning for me to be cordial. You got any coffee?
Where's my gun?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I need your help--
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
This is supposed to be years away.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
I know.  I'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile. If you want to experience the future, meet me in my office in 15 minutes. And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you...
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
I'm begging you...please don't kill me! Please!
Every time I said it, it was. I never really thought I was going to make it.
Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
I've spent over 50 hours interviewing him.  Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had butchered Sharon Tate. After seeing the blood bath on television, he wanted to show them how it should be done.  The question is, what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7?
I know who would know.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
He's part of the mix. Sid 6.7 is a composite.
And I'm going to make sure of it.  Give me your wrist.
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Nothing.
This isn't a game, Parker!
Both.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Sid 6.7 isn't Grimes.
Part of him is.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison.  You know, we have so much in common —— we have such history together ——I've been thinking we should become friends.
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
What are you saying...
It's <u>producing</u>.

But, but, but, "they" would find out.
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Yes.  That's true.  But...
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.

Why a beret?
...for the beans, yes...
Oh really.
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
It's Queens, Dad and a 5% mortgage and you rent the top room--I gotta live in Manhattan to be a player, Dad. There's no nobility in poverty anymore, y'know. One day you're going to be proud of me, you'll see... 
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
I guess it's time to hit the road.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
What if he asks where I got the money?
They won't. That's not their jurisdiction.
Yes! Read the Constitution, it's all in there. And remember--you don't know anything, nothing.
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
Yeah, right...
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
All right, Bud... let's do it.
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
...going places, good junk bond department, you got the financing on that Syndicam deal.
So whatta you got for me, sport? Why are you here?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...I can't even see it...
Sir Larry Wildman. Like all Brits he thinks he was born with a better pot to piss in... bribed an old secretary of mine to open bar mouth and stole RDL Pharmaceuticals right out from under me. Wildman the white knight.
I don't understand.
What about it? You work hard. I'll bet you stayed up all night analyzing that dog you bought. And where'd it get you?... my father worked hard too like an elephant pushing electrical supplies. And he dropped dead at 49 with a heart attack and a tax bill and the bank pissed on his grave and took the house; my mom ended up working in a dish factory... Wake up pal, if you're not inside you're outside. And I'm not talking a $200,000 a year working Wall Street stiff flying first class and being "comfortable", I'm talking rich pal, rich enough to fly in your own jet, rich enough not to waste time, 50-100 million, a player Bud -- or nothing. You had what it takes to let through my door. Next question: You got what it takes to stay...??
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
You're learning, sport...
Close to two million.  But this sucker can go all the way to Devon and the nationals.
Sure. What's worth doing is worth doing for money. It's a bad bargain where nobody gains. And if this deal goes through, we all gain.
Because it's wreckable. I took another look and I changed my mind.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Excuse me.
Only if I want something bad enough.
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
I don't.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
It's a winner Mr. Mannheim, trust me -- buy. 
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
Rip their throats out and put them in your garbage compactor.  Interesting. You got a card?
He still likes you
Businessman?
So why are you dating Jonathan?
What's that?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
A little what? CHINA See.  You don't even speak French.
Uh, not today Jenkins, I need the fresh air
Can I give her a message?
You don't happen to have the address do ya?
I've always wondered why someone would believe in something like that.
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Oh that explains everything.
Well divide 18 into three
They're all human beings
YES!
It's only two hours away.
No, he wouldn't.
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Well, that's what we're here for.
Your friend saw them.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Do you?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
No.  I'm just not sure what you mean.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Right.  Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I'm Claire Spencer.  From next door.
When...when will she be back?
You're the flower lady.
I've never even met you.
You do?
Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Um...sure.
I didn't sleep with him.
Oh God...
Stop.
Do we have to?
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Jody--
So you'll have some later.  Notice anything...different?
I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
What?
The planchette?
It's alright.
Jody, she's alive.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
I was down in Adamant...
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Alone?  On a two lane road?  With a ton of Valium in your system?
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
Jody he was lying.
It's Saturday.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Fine.
Yup.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
It's what I've been working for.
I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Unless you need me to come home...
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
I didn't do that.
We're going to be fine.
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
But then you've been so much better...
Claire, please...
We walked all night...
The...
...I'm positive this time...
Who?
So you fucked a student?!
And then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
I'm not going to listen to this.
Adamant.
Do you know it?
MADISON!
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Michael, Rowan should -
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
What are you talk---
C'mon now - give a little nod to Mayfair tradition.
It's over a month.    The police say it happens all the time.
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Who the hel1 -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
FAST.
There are things you will not tell him.
Always loved you..
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
I don't know what you are!!!
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
As far as touching things, yes. But the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    It won't go away God - if I could just understand it.
I'll bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I'm serious.  You don't -
Stop it.
You stop it.  you're loving, and gentel..  You're the most remarkable woman I've ever met --- so stop telling me I don't know what I feel just cause you're scared.  Cause it won't work.
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
What's wrong..?
- a witch.
I've come home, Michae1, for the first time.  I want to stay here - with you.
Michael - this is Beatrice Mayfair. And this is her brother, Giff---
And I thought I was the mindreader.
Mm-hmm...
A little sore.  Darm...   Finish up my section, will ya...?
Gotcha.
The guy I told you about - Aaron...?  He says I can learn to control them. That I could lose the gloves at some point.
Yes.   Partly.  It's - it's -  Stu - do you believe in ---
I like him.  He can stay.
That's right...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
What's with all the locks - and hammering
It says in the contract I can have a lock fitted - is there a problem ANGELA?
I'm a dentist
I don't know
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
It's what you would do to me
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Get out...
Yes...?
You and your pep talks.
I defy any and all limits.
For a guy about to try his first Dom Perignon, you are extremely uptight.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
What is it now?
Check it out!
Beauty? No. We're talking GODDESS.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
You'll never believe who's in there.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
Yeah?
So you'll think about it?
Things change. Now I'm taking off my clothes...all by myself.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
Don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?
We miss you. We miss our son.
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
...not the pit.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
It's okay. You need me?
What do you want me to do?
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary.
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
I understand.
Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation.
My new bike.
Better view, more spacious, new carpet. It's a no-brainer.
Just a formality.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
You're a peach.
That's a crappy thing to say.
It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
He didn't. He had it built.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
I know.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me.
You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever.
Keeping your word is something I can actually respect, Ted.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
Yellow pages?
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
Seldom? No kidding?
Why, look who's here.
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
I'm just a messenger.
It's about your parents.
Kelly.
Thanks.
I'd like that.
Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
It's a shithole.  But she was dirty, what was I gonna do?
The swamp, most likely... Lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  But he's made a mistake.
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's?  You'll give this up?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
Yeah.
Where's this coming from?
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You didn't cuff her?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
Because... it was the biggest I've ever seen.  And I've seen a lot on their way through Jack's Fish Camp.
What?
A ride.  You want one?
No.  But I mean... just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would...
I think we just need to get wasted.
Police -- God -- get a life.
Yes.  God, Mom...
Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.
Why can't you come...
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Hello.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That's not your line.
Say you love me.
Um-huh.  And guess what else?  I have toys.
There's nothing for them to get.
You'll get over it. We've got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against Sandra Van Ryan.
Detective Duquette, Ms. Van Ryan.  Let me in.  Now.
You can't...
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
You, Kelly, Sam.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
Come off it, man... It was an accident.
Jesus.  Two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
Jim West.
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
You need that real often?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
Good, I wasn't sure you were up to it.
All that jumping and kicking.
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
It's a repeating steam cannon!
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
It's better than nothing.
Not likely.  There must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  Freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
Oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
Well, let's help them with that. Take the legs.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Yes sir.
He had a pressing engagement.
Well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
When are they coming?
Is this what's left of your army?
You are very important, Willow.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
Real magic, Willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  You lack faith in your- self.  You must learn to trust your intuition.
He's no magician.
He turned that monster into stone!
Farmer.
Because she's sick.
The Fairy Queen?  And the baby here's a princess?  And these two rodents are your guides?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
Willow!
I know, I know!  But this is a way to get into that castle...
We need your help.  To take this baby to Tir Asleen.  She's a prin- cess.
Kill him!
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  But what's this got to do with it?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Me!
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
Queen Bavmorda transformed her.
I've seen pictures.
Yes, sir.
Are they going to kill you?
So one of them got to him.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Who else knows?
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
I've already got something worked out.  Be seeing you.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
I was wrong.
But why?
How long have I been here?
But you can't.
I know what he said.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I'm leaving tonight.  I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?
I know.
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
I don't believe you!
Times being what they were, I accepted the job, -- retaining my balloon against the advent of a quick get-away.  And in that balloon, my dear Dorothy, you and I will return to the land of E Pluribus Unum!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Very well! Throw that basket in the river and drown him!
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, no, I have to get to her right....
Oh, no, no!  I won't let you take him!  You go away, you....!  Oooh, I'll bite you myself!
Still, I wish I could remember.   But, I guess it doesn't matter anyway.  We know each other now, don't we?
Oh --
Oh, my!
The nerve.
Well, come on, then.  What are we waiting for?
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Did they hurtcha?
Ohhh!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
To Oz!
Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
Here -- here --
Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Who at?
What's the matter?
Fine.  He's got a plan
All right, I'll go in there for Dorothy -- Wicked Witch or no Wicked Witch -- guards or no guards -- I'll tear 'em apart.  I may not come out alive, but I'm going in there.  There's only one thing I want you fellows to do.
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
To Oz!
Emerald City!
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Don’t know any doctor jokes.
It’s a bomb alright. We’re still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
We go down to the torpedo bay.
Quite the opposite, in fact.
The inside man?
If you’ve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don’t need a third...
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
...you should rest.
I have to go.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
What are you talking about?
He killed me! He killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
Istanbul.
How would you know?
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Wrong answers?
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Life and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern me.
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Good night.
It's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.
What if you¹re wrong??
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
His . . . whatever.
Old?
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
Adrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
What about you?
What is that ungodly smell?
Yeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a roomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.  And whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us all look bad.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Before you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking at.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
Just remember, I'll be watching.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
My friend, if you're planning on crossing me...
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
But I hate cops, remember? Except for her.
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
You what? A wire transfer of this size?
He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play.  I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen.
Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
"Anarchy" 99"?
What do you get if you finish?
Like what?
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Whoever sent you knew what they were doing. You and Yorgi are practically twins. Two nihilistic fashion victims who make a lot of noise but don't say much.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
We could work together. Then maybe we could both get the hell out of here. There's a beach in Bora Bora with my name on it.
There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true.
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece.
Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice.
We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Aren't you afraid?
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
Here we go again.
What's the deal?
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
I appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Whatever you want, the rest of the night, consider it on the house.
I'm talking about the sports cars that disappear off the docks in Genoa and wind up here. If you don't know about 'em, who does?
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
He calls me sport one more time, and I'll blow a watermelon-sized hole through him.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
You mutant bastards...
Gosh, I hope so.
Who?
Deal.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
ALIVE.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
... No!
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
MMmmm.
You're incorrigible!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Give me a hand with these, will you, Ayegor?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
Why does he call you 'master'?
I suppose you're right.
That's my good boy.
May I have it, please?
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
Good.
Yes?
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
But your grandfather's work, sir...
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
I see.
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
Two switches over there, but I wasn't going to be the first.
Could be worse!
I have a pretty good idea.
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You mustn't take it so hard. Bucharest wasn't built in a day.
To you!  You just made a 'yummy' sound, so I thought you liked the dessert.
Yes.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
How's everything?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Wait!  Stop!  Don't give them the satisfaction.  I know it's tough, but look at how far we've come! Are you going to throw it all away now??
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
Inga, wake up!
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Well, this explains the music.
I think I'll...carry him.
I think so.
I know Frederick.
Of course not.
Yes, Elizabeth has hers.
Well...  ... perhaps for a few minutes.
MMmmm.
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Do you know the theme from 'Doctor Zhivago'?
Food!
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
But will they make good use of them?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
I think Chelmsford wants a good man on the border Why he fears a flanking attack and requires a steady Commander in reserve.
